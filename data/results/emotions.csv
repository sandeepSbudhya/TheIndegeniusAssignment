Petrol prices have surged past A$2 a litre, and the cost of food is rising because of COVID-19, floods and climate change.Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese was quick to criticise the budget, likening it to “fake tan” and claiming that the one-off cost-of-living payments are more about winning the upcoming election than planning for the future.

Though they played in empty stadiums, athletes nevertheless put up marvellous displays of power, beauty and the spirit of sports. Sports teach us a lot about ourselves. But what role do they play in the lives of the world’s indigenous communities?Do indigenous people make better sportspersons? Certainly, India’s Olympic squad has always had several members from Adivasi areas, with many bringing laurels for the country. At the global level too, the performance of Cathy Freeman in the 2000 Sydney Olympics is remembered to this day. Yet, why are there exclusive events like the World Indigenous Games?To get answers to these questions, Down To Earth spoke to Christian Wacker, the president of the ISOH, The international Society of Olympic Historians.

93,"- Organizations representing hundreds of thousands of Indigenous people in South America make public appeal for action- Fate of unique uncontacted tribe now at a “tipping point” between survival and extermination- Paraguay’s government has stood by and watched for years as illegal deforestation threatens the group- Urgent call for the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations to interveneLeading Indigenous organizations from across South America have made an unprecedented public appeal for urgent action to prevent the genocide of one of the most threatened uncontacted tribes in the world.Uncontacted members of Paraguay’s Ayoreo tribe are the last uncontacted Indigenous people in South America outside the Amazon.Uncontacted Ayoreo on the day they were forced out of the forest, 2004. © GAT/SurvivalVast swathes of the once-extensive Chaco forest have been cut down all around them, so the Ayoreo now live in an ever-shrinking island of forest surrounded by a sea of destruction. The area suffers the fastest rate of deforestation in the world.Although contacted members of the tribe submitted a formal land claim to the authorities in 1993, only some parcels of land have been returned to them (following lengthy battles). Most of the Ayoreo’s ancestral forest remains in private ",neutral
94,"While the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed inequalities faced by the world’s indigenous people, such as poor access to healthcare, it has also led to greater understanding of their priorities, which include social cohesion and protecting the planet.That’s the opinion of Ghazali Ohorella, an international lawyer and indigenous rights advocate who is an Alifuru from Maluku, which is part of Indonesia.Dianne Penn spoke to Mr. Ohorella ahead of the annual UN commemoration of the International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples on 9 August.He expressed why global dialogue on post-pandemic recovery, including to address climate change, biodiversity loss and other challenges, could see indigenous people finally sitting “at the table” instead of being “on the menu”.But first Mr. Ohorella explained where he is from.

95,"Brazil’s highest court has upheld a ban on missionaries entering reserves that are home to isolated and recently contacted Indigenous people during the pandemic.The decision comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Indigenous organizations against a law passed in July 2020 that allowed missionaries to remain inside these reserves despite the pandemic, in violation of Brazil’s official policy in place since 1987.According to Indigenous organizations, it’s crucial to reaffirm the non-contact policy under the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro that has pushed to “integrate” Indigenous people into society, and has been cozy with the evangelical movement.Besides the risk of disease spread, the presence of missionaries in these reserves undermines traditional cultures and social cohesion, and compels these nomadic communities to settle down, making the land more vulnerable to invasions by illegal ranchers and loggers, activists say.Brazil’s highest court has upheld a ban on missionary activity inside reserves that are home to isolated or recently contacted Indigenous people, in a bid to protect the communities against COVID-19.Although the country’s official indigenist policy toward these groups since 1987 has been to not engage in any contact, regardless of whether there’s a pandemic, a federal law passed in July 2020 allows religious ",neutral
96,"Promotion of net-zero climate targets may alienate tribals from their land when science tells us that there is simply not enough landThe impacts of climate change have become tangible, and polluters across the world can no longer just pretend to care. So they have come up with yet another pledge (in a long list of unfulfilled pledges): The ‘net-zero’ goal, which has all the potential to worsen the ongoing climate injustices faced by the marginalised indigenous communities.Net-zero is about balancing total emitted greenhouse gases (GHG) with total GHG removals from the atmosphere (negative emissions) over a specified time. It makes sense as a scientific concept, but since carbon-capture technologies remain unproven, most of the ‘netting’ will rely on land-based removal and storage of carbon dioxide.A new report by Oxfam, a confederation of 20 charitable organisations focusing on the alleviation of global poverty, on net-zero has warned how these poorly defined climate targets can end up relying on vast swathes of land to capture carbon emissions, allowing the biggest emitters to continue business as usual and distracting us from demanding real action from them, which is to ask for significant and rapid cuts in their own emissions.The report also warned that ",neutral
97,"Today is National Close the Gap Day, a day to reflect on the gap in health and wellbeing outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Australians.All of us can contribute to closing the gap by working together to recognise and address the factors behind the health gap.The Morrison Government continues to take strong and effective action towards achieving parity in health outcomes. In the past year, we have announced new commitments totalling more than $1.1 billion for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, targeted to priority areas including birthweight, early childhood, aged care and mental health.To continue to improve the health and wellbeing of Indigenous communities, the Morrison Government will on Friday open a $140 million major capital works program for Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHS) to build, buy or renovate health clinics and staff housing.A key part of the Government’s $254 million Closing the Gap health infrastructure measure announced in August 2021, the funding will deliver up to 120 projects, including new health clinics, housing, and major refurbishments.ACCHS are operated by and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, delivering comprehensive and culturally appropriate primary health care services.Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, said the grants ",approval
98,"The Seattle City Council voted 7-0 on Tuesday to solidify Indigenous Peoples Day and Juneteenth as city holidays beginning this year, approving several actions formalizing council efforts that started in December. Tuesday’s bill expanded recent efforts to establish Indigenous Peoples Day as a legal holiday for more city employees and as a parking holiday. It also authorized memorandums of understanding with multiple labor unions recognizing both holidays. “Although the city has already established Indigenous Peoples Day as a day of observance and legal holiday for city employees represented by the Coalition [of City Unions], legislation is required to expand this holiday to unrepresented city employees and establish a parking holiday,” said Council President Debora Juarez, who sponsored the legislation and is the first Indigenous president of the council. In the 1970s, The International Conference on Discrimination Against Indigenous Populations in the Americas began to advocate for a celebration of Native Americans on what was then — and is still in some areas — celebrated as Columbus Day. Since then, Indigenous Peoples Day has been observed on the second Monday of October. In 2014, the council passed a resolution — co-sponsored by Councilmember Kshama Sawant and now-Mayor Bruce Harrell “encouraging other ",neutral
