Sri Lanka's last indigenous people,"""This is our cave,"" said the man. He was tall with curly, shoulder-length hair and his lower lip was caked red with the areca nut he was chewing. An orange sarong was tied around his waist and a small axe was slung over his left shoulder. He pointed at a dimly lit rock shelter guarded by swaying trees.""This is where the children lived,"" he said, gesturing to a dark corner, ""and here, the men and women. You see the top there,"" he continued, showing a sun-lit platform sheathed by scattered boulders. ""That's where our leader slept, and we burnt wild boars, deer and rabbits to eat.""Gunabandilaaththo belongs to the Vedda community, the earliest known aboriginal people of Sri Lanka. For centuries, his people were forest dwellers who foraged, hunted and lived in close-knit groups in caves in the dense jungles of Sri Lanka, relocating from one cave to another when someone from the group died. After one's death, they laid the body on the cave floor and covered it with leaves while gathering by a large tree to pray for the deceased; and offered wild meat, honey and wild tubers to their ancestors and the deities of the trees, rivers and jungles. ""We prayed for their afterlife so that their souls will belong to the deities; they will look after us,"" he said.Today, the Vedda live scattered in tiny settlements in the Hunnasgiriya hills in central Sri Lanka up to the coastal lowlands in the island's east. However, long before Indo-Aryans – who are now the dominant Sinhalese-Buddhist people – came to Sri Lanka from India around 543 BCE, the Vedda lived all around the island.Despite being Sri Lanka's earliest inhabitants, many people know little to nothing about them. For many centuries, Veddas were stigmatised and oppressed by the Sinhalese rule, and limited only to tourist interest. Today Veddas are thought to account for less than 1% of the national population."

B.C. reveals 89-point action plan to advance the rights of Indigenous Peoples,"The province has unveiled a five-year, 89-point action plan to advance the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), which became legislation in B.C. over two years ago.Hailed as historic by government and Indigenous leaders speaking at its unveiling, the plan outlines a list of ""significant actions"" the province is promising to undertake in consultation and cooperation with Indigenous Peoples.Chief Jerry Jack of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations said the document charts a path to a renewed relationship with government and reconciliation.""I commend this significant effort,"" said Jack. ""What [Indigenous Peoples] have been going through is multi-generational. I went with my dad to blockades in the 1970s, fighting for our rights. I don't want my grandchildren to still have to fight for our rights, our land back.""The 89 actions address a wide range of issues, including governance, land and water stewardship, salmon, education, anti-indigenous racism, child welfare, policing and justice, data collection, health care, sport and recreation, Indigenous languages, climate change, B.C. place names, cannabis policy and high-speed internet access.Each of the 89 actions notes which provincial ministry is responsible for its implementation.Premier John Horgan called the plan a roadmap to do ""what has never been done on planet Earth before.""""This ... is a first for any government in the world. It will drive transformative change in the relationship with Indigenous Peoples and help us build a brighter future for everyone,"" said Horgan.B.C. became the first jurisdiction in North America to adopt UNDRIP when the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act was passed unanimously by the legislative assembly in 2019.Rosalie Yazzie of the B.C. First Nations Justice Council urged quick action on the justice front to address the inherent racism and over-representation of Indigenous people in the justice system.""We cannot ask people who are suffering the way so many Indigenous Peoples are to keep waiting. We either make changes that address this issue in real ways, or we are failing,"" she said.""Reconciliation is a process that takes us all out of our comfort zone and if you don't feel uncomfortable you're not doing it right.""Murray Rankin, minister of Indigenous relations and reconciliation, defended the plan as more than aspirational, saying the 89 actions are ""tangible, measurable and achievable"" in the five-year period.""We will be held accountable every year in a real way,"" said Rankin. ""[The plan] will not gather dust, it cannot, it's not allowed to.""B.C. Green MLA Adam Olsen, a member of the Tsartlip First Nation, criticized the action plan as ""lay[ing] the groundwork for excuse making.""""The metric for success is not what we hear but what we see. Twenty-eight months after the Declaration Act was unanimously passed in the legislature, this government is only just moving forward,"" he said. ""This plan outlines goals for reconciliation, but not the metrics for achieving them."""
Study shows higher COVID-19 death rates for Indigenous people,"American Indians and Alaska Natives appear to be at higher risk for death from COVID-19 despite having similar rates of chronic health conditions, a new study has found. Photo by Adi Weda/EPA-EFEMarch 30 (UPI) -- American Indians and Alaska Natives in the United States are more likely to die from COVID-19 than Black and White Americans, even without the chronic conditions that place people at higher risk for serious illness from the virus, a study published Wednesday by JAMA Network Open found. Black Americans in Mississippi hospitalized with COVID-19 were 75% less likely to die from the virus compared to American Indians and Alaska Natives, the data showed. AdvertisementSimilarly, White Americans in the state hospitalized with the virus had a 77% lower risk for death after infection than these Indigenous populations, the researchers said.This is despite American Indians and Alaska Natives in the study having similar or lower rates of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity compared to Black and White American participants, according to the researchers.Previous research has found that having heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and/or obesity increases a person's risk for serious illness and death from COVID-19 infection, making them ""comorbidities"" in medical terms, they said.Advertisement""American Indian and Alaska Native adults [were] younger than all other races when admitted [to the hospital] with COVID-19 and [had] a lower mean comorbidity prevalence than Black or White patients,"" study co-author Leslie A. Musshafen told UPI in an email.Still, ""they had the longest average length of stay in the hospital and died while in the hospital at two to four times the rate of all other races,"" said Musshafen, executive director of research at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson.Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, communities of color, including American Indians and Alaska Natives, have been at increased risk for infection, serious illness and death from the virus, research indicates.This is due to many factors, including poorer overall health in these communities and lack of access to needed care services, studies have found.Early in the pandemic, American Indian reservations experienced some of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks seen nationally.The findings of this study are based on an analysis of data for nearly 19,000 people in Mississippi hospitalized with COVID-19 in 2020.Most of the included patients were adults ages 50 to 75 years, and 54% were women, the researchers said.AdvertisementJust over 1% of the patients in the study American Indians and Alaska Natives, while 49% were Black Americans and 49% were White Americans, according to the researchers.COVID-19 deaths were evaluated against rates of 31 chronic health conditions known to increase the risk for severe illness from the virus for Black, White and American Indian and Alaska Native patients included in the study, they said.For example, 27% of the American Indian and Alaska Native patients in the study had obesity compared with 33% of Black patients and 24% of White patients, the data showed.In addition, 39% of the American Indian and Alaska Native patients in the study had ""uncomplicated"" high blood pressure, or high blood pressure without heart-related complications, the researchers said.For the Black and White patients in the study, this figure was 47% and 48%, respectively, according to the researchers.Despite these findings, American Indian and Alaska Native patients were more than twice as likely to die from COVID-19 as Black or White patients, the data showed.""The significant impact that social determinants have on the health of all populations is undeniable, during the pandemic and beyond, [and] we must account for these complex factors to improve the health of a population,"" Musshafen said.Advertisement""In Mississippi, for instance, a single Indian Health Service facility provides healthcare for American Indians across the entire state [and] those needing higher acuity care [there] had to be transferred to a facility in another region of the state, potentially delaying care,"" she said."
Pope meets Canada Indigenous groups seeking apology for abuse of children,"Pope Francis has heard first-hand the horrors of abuse committed at church-run residential schools in Canada, as Indigenous delegations pressed him for an apology.Indigenous survivors are visiting the Vatican this week for meetings with the pope about the scandal that has rocked the Catholic church.More than 1,300 unmarked graves have been discovered since last May at church-run schools attended by Canada’s Indigenous children as part of a government policy of forced assimilation.“The pope listened … (he) heard just three of the many stories we have to share,” Cassidy Caron, president of the Métis National Council, told journalists in front of St Peter’s Square. “While the time for acknowledgment, apology and atonement is long overdue, it is never too late to do the right thing.”Francis also held a private audience with representatives of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami.The 85-year-old pontiff is scheduled to receive a delegation from the Assembly of First Nations on Thursday, before a final group meeting on Friday.The Catholic church in Canada has apologised “unequivocally” to Canada’s Indigenous peoples for a century of abuses at church-run residential schools.Francis has also expressed his “pain” at the scandal – but has not gone so far as to offer an apology himself.“We really truly hoped that … (at) this meeting today, that the pope would listen … and hopefully bring an apology when he does arrive in Canada,” Caron said.According to Canadian bishops, Francis has indicated a willingness to visit Canada, though no date has yet been set.Caron said the pope had echoed the Métis’ request for “truth, justice and healing”, saying she took that as a sign of “a personal commitment”.Approximately 150,000 Indigenous children, including Métis and Inuit, were enrolled from the late 1800s to the 1990s in 139 of the residential schools across Canada, spending months or years isolated from their families, language and culture.Many were physically and sexually abused by headmasters and teachers, and thousands are believed to have died of disease, malnutrition or neglect.A truth and reconciliation commission concluded in 2015 the failed government policy amounted to “cultural genocide”.The 32 delegates visiting the Vatican say an apology from Francis in Canada would be “an important step” in the healing process.“Primarily the reconciliation requires action. And we still are in need of very specific actions from the Catholic church,” said Natan Obed, president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, who led the Inuit delegation. He cited the reparations the Canadian church has been ordered to pay, as well as justice for victims of a Catholic Oblate priest accused of multiple cases of sexual abuse who is now living in France."
Will Pope Francis apologize to Canada's indigenous people?,"AsiaWill Pope Francis apologize to Canada's indigenous people?He has taken the first step to healing the wounds inflicted by the Church by meeting indigenous delegationsA Canadian man sits and prays at the field where the remains of over 750 children were buried on the site of the former Marieval Indian Residential School in Cowessess First Nation, Saskatchewan, on June 25, 2021. (Photo: AFP)By Ben Joseph Published: March 30, 2022 10:28 AM GMT Updated: March 30, 2022 10:51 AM GMTPope Francis is under pressure to clear a blot on the escutcheon of the Catholic Church caused by the forceful assimilation of indigenous children in Canada.Canada’s indigenous schools became a fly in the ointment of the Church's good intentions when it tried to help North America indigenous people after they faced disease, hunger and the loss of their traditional economy during colonial and modern times.From 1831 to 1996, at least 150,000 indigenous children were forcefully separated from their homes and placed into some 139 residential schools. The Church and its religious orders ran more than two-thirds of the schools.Thank you. You are now signed up to Daily newsletterSIGN UP NOW! Stay up to date Don't miss out on the latest NewsAccording to Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which probed the Indian residential school system, an estimated 4,100 to 6,000 students died at these schools and their bodies were buried in mass graves within school premises.The children, buried secretly en masse, are reported to have breathed their last due to Spanish flu, measles or the evil actions of their protectors, according to the commission (2008-19).Adding a sinister element is the fact that the graves were hidden and there was not one headstone or cross to mark them despite the schools being managed by two resourceful churches — Catholic and Anglican.The students reportedly did not receive proper medication and decent burials, nor were their families informed of their illness and deathsTwo sets of delegates — one from the Métis National Council and another from the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami — had separate meetings with Pope Francis on March 28. Another delegation from the Assembly of First Nations was scheduled to meet him on March 31.The delegations comprise indigenous elders, knowledge keepers, residential school survivors and youths. They represent 1.67 million indigenous people who make up nearly 5 percent of Canada’s 38 million people.The groups asked Pope Francis to visit Canada and publicly apologize there for the Church's treatment of indigenous people and its collaboration with colonizers. The Vatican has said the pope is willing to make the trip but has not said when.The papal meeting with indigenous people had been set for June 2021 following the discovery of unmarked graves at residential schools in Canada but did not take place due to the pandemic and a surge in Covid-19 infections in Italy.At least 6,000 students died, though the number could be higher. They were put into crowded, church-run boarding schools, where they were abused and banned from speaking their languages as part of cultural assimilation used as a ploy to undermine the native resistance to the dispossession of local habitats.The students reportedly did not receive proper medication and decent burials, nor were their families informed of their illness and deaths.Some survivors said the bodies of infants born to girls impregnated by priests and monks were also dumped in the secret mass graves, The New York Times reported on July 24, 2021.The mainstreaming of the local populace required a systematic denigration of their cultures and languages, which was conducted under seemingly benevolent civilizing education.After collecting more than 7,000 statements from indigenous people, the state-funded commission arrived at the conclusion that the assimilation policy was “cultural genocide.”The Truth and Reconciliation Commission had sought a papal apology for the role of the Church and Trudeau made a personal appeal to the Vatican, but the pope has still not taken that stepThe biggest discoveries of the remains of 751 children in Saskatchewan and a mass grave of 215 children in a former church-run school in British Columbia were called “part of a larger tragedy” by Canada's Catholic Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.In what is officially called the largest settlement against forceful assimilation, Canada announced a US$31.5 billion settlement on Jan. 4 to compensate indigenous families who suffered because of the residential school system.A part of it will be set aside to improve the child welfare system of a nation where indigenous children make up more than half of those in foster care, according to a 2016 census.According to the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, Pope Francis will meet representatives of the three major groups of indigenous people.The Truth and Reconciliation Commission had sought a papal apology for the role of the Church and Trudeau made a personal appeal to the Vatican, but the pope has still not taken that step.In contrast, the United Church of Canada, the country’s largest Protestant denomination, apologized in 1998 for its role in running the Indian residential school system.The delegation may ask Pope Francis for an apology for the Church’s role, the release of all records related to residential schools, and the return of any indigenous records that the Vatican may possess in its archives.Pope Francis has taken the first step by meeting the indigenous delegations to heal the wounds inflicted by the Church.

Does the pre-election budget address ways to realistically 'close the gap' for Indigenous people?,"As Treasurer Josh Frydenberg handed down the federal government’s pre-election budget on Tuesday night, I watched in anticipation to see what it would hold for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and communities.It’s an important issue, particularly in light of the government’s 2020 commitment to new targets to address the ever-growing disparities between Indigenous peoples and the rest of the population that have yet to be adequately addressed.It was no surprise to see a strong budget focus on the cost of living. Petrol prices have surged past A$2 a litre, and the cost of food is rising because of COVID-19, floods and climate change.Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese was quick to criticise the budget, likening it to “fake tan” and claiming that the one-off cost-of-living payments are more about winning the upcoming election than planning for the future. The problem with fake tan, he said, is that “it fades pretty quickly”.Unfortunately, Indigenous people are used to disappointing budgets that lack the strategic planning needed to address real issues that Indigenous communities themselves constantly raise.True, the cost of living is soaring for many Australians. But like all things, this is never an even playing field. The cost of living in remote Aboriginal communities beggars belief. It is so outrageous that it triggered a federal parliamentary inquiry in 2020.Perhaps not unexpectedly, the inquiry failed to deliver any meaningful results. Petrol prices have also been extremely high in rural and remote locations for a long time, significantly impacting Indigenous communities. For example, petrol prices have reached as high as $3 a litre in Arnhem Land.Read more: There's $1.3 billion for women's safety in the budget and it's nowhere near enoughWhat’s in the budget for us?So, what’s in the 2022 pre-election budget that will address the new targets set by the government? Federal Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt said in his budget-night press release that the Morrison government has embarked on “the most ambitious Indigenous policy reform agendas”.The federal budget should address the needs in the broader community, but also the targeted commitments that the government makes, such as those outlined in the Closing the Gap scheme.The government has pledged $636.4 million in the 2022 budget over six years to expand Indigenous land and sea management on Country. This will provide more education and employment opportunities in remote and regional Australia. Given the lack of any real commitment to climate change, I guess the government is hoping Indigenous rangers will do the work so urgently required.Housing in remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory has been allocated $408 million. The funding will be used for addressing overcrowding, homelessness and much-needed improvements to homes. The government has also allocated $183 million over the next three years to improve economic, social and health outcomes for Indigenous people in the NT.Although homelessness and affordable housing is a major concern for Indigenous people across Australia, no funding was committed to other locations. Yet most Indigenous people live in urban areas. In Victoria, for example, the number of Indigenous people seeking help from services for housing issues has increased by 33.6% over four years – the highest rate for Indigenous people anywhere in Australia.Is the budget addressing the Indigenous health gap?The budget promises an estimated $16.2 million for Indigenous health spending across 2022-23. Specifically, the funding is to combat blood-borne viruses and sexually transmissible infections in the Torres Strait, and improving trachoma control services. Australia is the only developed country where trachoma still exists. It only impacts Indigenous people, and is directly related to overcrowding and poor housing conditions, including access to clean water and sanitation.The federal government has also pledged $12 million towards combating rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in Indigenous communities, which continue to have one of the highest rates in the developed world. The ABC 4 Corners report Heart Failure highlighted the ongoing impacts of racism in the health system and the appalling lack of healthcare provided.The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO) has expressed disappointment at what it describes as the budget’s failure to adequately fund Indigenous health, even though the disparities in health between Indigenous peoples and other populations in Australia are supposedly one of the key areas of the government’s commitment.The organisation’s chief executive, Pat Turner, said:As long as this $4.4 billion funding gap remains and as long as there are funding gaps elsewhere – in particular, in housing – we cannot expect the unconscionable health gap to close. This Budget is an opportunity lost. NACCHO calls upon the government to close the funding gap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.Last year, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the “ultimate test” of closing the gap would be that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in particular would have the same opportunities as other children in Australia.On this scale, the federal government has failed miserably. Indigenous children in Australia are ten times more likely to be removed from their families.Catherine Liddle, chief executive of SNAICC, the national peak body for Aboriginal children and families, expressed the frustration Indigenous people have on this issue:People have been saying this for a long time, yet the change in investment and transformation to the system that’s required to fix it hasn’t followed through.Turner and Liddle both also highlighted the considerable shortfall in the commitment needed to meet the ambitious targets set out in the Closing the Gap agreement.Overall, the budget falls short of adequate investment across key areas such as health, housing, education and employment. It also fails to provide funding to address the high number of Indigenous deaths in custody and to support families facing the financial burden of seeking legal justice.Frydenberg acknowledged the women’s safety crisis in Australia, and the government has reiterated its support for a dedicated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Action Plan led by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Council on family, domestic and sexual violence. But the budget fails to fund Aboriginal family violence and legal services where resources are urgently needed.The co-chair of the First Nations-led coalition Change the Record, Cheryl Axleby, said that if a budget was a reflection of a government’s priorities, it’s clear that First Nations’ needs are a long way down the list."
Why are Indigenous people being left out of climate conversations?,"Student climate protest in Melbourne. Credit: ShutterstockThe urgency of tackling climate change is even greater for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and other First Nation peoples across the globe. First Nations people will be disproportionately affected and are already experiencing existential threats from climate change.The unfolding disaster in the Northern Rivers regions of New South Wales is no exception, with Aboriginal communities completely inundated or cut off from essential supplies.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have protected Country for millennia and have survived dramatic climatic shifts. We are intimately connected to Country, and our knowledge and cultural practices hold solutions to the climate crisis. Despite this, we continue to be excluded from leadership roles in climate solution discussions, such as the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.This continued exclusion is why investigation of the impacts of climate change on First Nations people is needed.In October last year, the Lowitja Institute, in partnership with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander National Health Leadership Forum and the Climate and Health Alliance, brought together researchers, community members, young people and advocates from across the country at a round-table discussion.Together, they put together the findings for the Discussion Paper Climate change and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health.How climate change impacts Indigenous peoplesAs the paper tells us, climate change threatens our social and cultural determinants of health, including access to Country, traditional foods, safe water, appropriate housing and health services.Aboriginal health services are already struggling to operate in extreme weather, with increasing demands and a reduced workforce. All these forces combine to exacerbate already unacceptable levels of ill-health within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations and compound the historical and contemporary injustices of colonization.During the round table, we heard powerful and moving stories from communities on the front line of climate change.Norman Frank Jupurrurla, a community leader from Tennant Creek, spoke of sacred waterholes drying up, ancient shade trees dying, temperatures rising, inadequate housing, power going out and spoiled essential food and medicines.Vanessa Napaltjarri Davis, a Warlpiri/Northern Arrente woman and Senior Researcher at Tangentyere Council in Mparntwe/Alice Springs, spoke of changes to the availability of bush foods and medicines—essential to our health and well-being—due to changing temperatures and seasons.For example, as Norman Frank Jupurrurla wrote: ""…now the country is burning, getting destroyed, because of climate change. Already, I cannot see sand goannas any more.""Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples hold a deep and painful knowledge of the role dominant culture, racism and colonial power dynamics play within climate change. Although there have been many suggested solutions to climate change, access to these solutions is not equally or equitably available across Australia.Norman Frank Jupurrurla demonstrated this when he shared the almost impossibly drawn-out process he has completed to become the first person to install solar panels on public housing in Tennant Creek, Northern Territory.Listening to Aboriginal communities experiencing the profound health impacts of climate change is essential to guiding government responses Aboriginal leaders tell @CroakeyVoice @LowitjaInstitut roundtable on #IndigenousClimateJustice21 https://t.co/Od4m7EiXIc #HealthyCOP26 — CroakeyVoices (@CroakeyVoices) November 17, 2021Indigenous peoples' voices excluded from climate change conversationsColonization has ignored Indigenous ways of knowing, doing and being, right down to the weather. Colonizers insisted we live according to just four seasons, instead of the many seasons our people knew and respected.This experience of marginalization continues today where we have not been sufficiently included in national and international conversations about climate change, including being pushed to the sidelines at COP26.The IPCC acknowledged this globally in its report last year. The report states that data and most reporting on climate change do not include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander or local knowledge in the assessment findings.The IPCC's most recent report looks to recognize this omission and focuses specifically on the importance of our role and knowledge in addressing the climate crisis and the need for climate justice.The calls from our work are clear. We must elevate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices within climate change action and center Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as leaders in protecting Country. In the words of Seed Mob, ""We cannot have climate justice without First Nations justice.""In seeking solutions, we must consider how colonial ideologies and practices around climate change can impact on our peoples. As Rhys Jones wrote, ""It is not possible to understand and address climate-related health impacts for Indigenous peoples without examining this broader context of colonial oppression, marginalization and dispossession.""The Uluru Statement from the Heart, a gift to the Australian People, provides the road map for action:We must correct power asymmetries and establish co-governance arrangements and become strong advocates of, not only our interests, but our capabilities to tackle climate change.We must restore access to basic rights that will lay the groundwork for action that includes appropriate community participation/decision-making and incorporates cultural, environmental and sustainable design.We must weave our knowledges and strengthen partnerships to ensure that our collective wisdom and knowledge as Australia's First Nations is integrated into climate adaptation and mitigation planning, directly benefitting the whole nation.Indigenous people know about this continent; we've looked after it for millennia.The Uluru Statement from the Heart gives the opportunity to restore that ancient power—for the benefit of us all and the survival of the planet.Explore further IPCC reports still exclude Indigenous voices.

OPINION: “Save the symbol of our relationship with indigenous people as a way to honor our mutual past”,"“Dear Dartmouth citizens:My name is Bob Sisson, I grew up on Smith Neck Road and attended and graduated from the Dartmouth School system in 1971. I was a member of the football and track teams, though not very good.I feel I have a unique perspective on the current issue of the use of an indigenous person as a symbol of Dartmouth Pride. I am the 13th generation of one of the founders of Dartmouth, Richard Sisson who had a home at the Head of Westport River in 1635. My father Dick was a star athlete for Dartmouth High and is in our Hall of Fame. He was also a coach and phys ed teacher in Dartmouth.I caught a break and was fortunate to obtain a Ph.D. in Psychology. Earlier in my career, I spent time on several Native American reservations including Pine Ridge in South Dakota in the 80s where the American Indian Movement was organized. I also have been a consultant to local school districts in the special education departments including Dartmouth.As I grew up in Dartmouth in the 50s and 60s, as I aged, I became aware that Dartmouth was not always a shining beacon of equality for all its citizens; Jews, Blacks, and Portuguese.On the other hand, I can honestly say I have never heard any disparaging remarks about Native Americans, Blacks, or Jews while in school or as an adult in Dartmouth. Sports and other extra curriculum activities are a great way to make friends different from yourself. The citizens of Dartmouth I feel are great people free of prejudices and continue to make strides in equality for all.Native American history was taught briefly in our schools. Our early settlers, particularly Quakers, were very involved with their native neighbors. Many Appongansettes became Christians and there was a Native church on Horseneck Road. More could be taught in the schools.But this is not the first time outsiders have butted into Dartmouth’s long-time residents’ relationship with original inhabitants. During the King Phillip War, Puritans from Boston and Plimouth imprisoned peaceful Appongansettes and sold them into slavery.Don’t let history repeat itself. Please save the symbol of our relationship with indigenous people as a way to honor our mutual past. I know my dad would be for it as I grew up with a large similar symbol on my bedroom door.” -Bob Sisson, PhD."

Dams on Brazil’s Jamanxim River: The advancing assault on the environment and Indigenous peoples in the Tapajós basin (commentary),"Brazil’s electrical authorities have given the go-ahead for studies to prepare for building three large Amazonian dams that would flood Indigenous lands and protected areas for biodiversity.The decision shows that Brazil’s presidential administration is confident that the National Congress will approve the bill submitted by President Bolsonaro to open Indigenous lands to hydroelectric dams, and probably also allow dams to continue to be built without consulting impacted Indigenous peoples.The decision also shows that Brazil’s electrical authorities continue to ignore inconvenient information on climate change, the financial viability of Amazonian dams and their many social and environmental impacts, as well as the country’s better energy options.This text is translated and expanded from the author’s column on the Amazônia Real website. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily of Mongabay.Brazil’s Amazon dam plans have been slowed down over the past decade due to realization by the country’s electrical authorities that obtaining environmental licenses would be difficult when Indigenous peoples are impacted, despite the government’s success in forcing approval of dams such as Belo Monte. Teles Pires (see here and here) and São Manoel that clearly violate the rights of these people as guaranteed by Brazil’s constitution Article 321, Laws (Decree nº 10.088/2019; formerly Law No. 5051 of 19 April 2004) and commitments under International Labor Organization Convention 169. Three of the planned large dams that had been stalled would be built in the state of Pará on the Jamanxim River, a tributary of the Tapajós River, which is a major tributary of the Amazon River. A clear sign that this hesitancy has changed has now surged forth with Brazil’s parastatal electrical holding company (ELETROBRÁS: Centrais Elétricas do Brasil) and its subsidiary ELETRONORTE (Centrais Elétricas do Norte do Brasil, S.A.) requesting (and on 24 January 2022 obtaining) an extension of a deadline from the National Agency for Electrical Energy (ANEEL) to allow drafting economic viability studies for these dams (see here and here).This shows that the Brazilian federal government continues to refuse to recognize both the enormous environmental and human costs of Amazonian dams and the fact that Brazil has energy options far better than dams not only in terms of impacts but also on financial grounds (see here, here, here and here). It also shows that the government authorities are counting on the enactment of President Jair Bolsonaro’s bill 191/2020, now rapidly advancing in the National Congress, to open Indigenous lands to hydroelectric dams, as well as to mining, logging and agribusiness operations by non-Indigenous entrepreneurs. President Bolsonaro has even used the war in Ukraine as a justification for opening Indigenous lands for mining by approving bill 191/2020, which would also open them for dams. The false excuse that this bill must be passed so that potassium can be mined in Indigenous lands to replace imports from Russia was successful in winning approval of the lower house of congress for conceding “urgent” status to the bill and bypassing committee procedures, thus allowing the bill itself to be voted by as soon as mid-April.The three dams just announced (Cachoeira do Caí, Jamanxim and Cachoeira dos Patos: Table 1) were the subject of preliminary studies during the 2008 inventory of the Tapajós River basin (see here, pp. 111-142). The Cachoeira do Caí Dam would flood part of the Sawré-Mubyu Indigenous area, which would also be partly flooded by the planned São Luiz do Tapajós Dam on the Tapajós River (Figure 1). All three reservoirs would flood in the Jamanxim National Park, and two of the dams themselves would be located inside the park (Figure 2).Table 1.

This type of dam has greater impacts than run-of-river dams, which use the natural flow to generate power. Storage dams generally have larger reservoirs compared to their installed capacities, thus flooding more land (and people), and the water in the reservoir usually stratifies into layers, thus providing ideal conditions for producing a powerful greenhouse gas: methane. In 2013 then President Dilma Rousseff announced a change in policy to prioritize storage dams over run-of-river dams, and this has been maintained by subsequent presidents.Environmental impacts include loss of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, as with other Amazonian dams. Amazonian dams can also emit substantial amounts of greenhouse gases, particularly methane (see here and here). The three proposed dams have been calculated to cause a greater impact on global warming than generating the electricity from gas, oil and even coal (Figure 2). This considers impact of the gases over a 20-year period, which is the time frame within which global warming must be brought under control to avoid the catastrophic consequences of passing tipping points in the global climate system.The virtually total lack of oxygen at the bottom of a reservoir like those of the planned dams results in methane being produced when organic matter decays in the sediments. The same conditions lead to the chemically similar process of mercury methylation, converting elemental mercury into the highly toxic methylmercury. Mercury has accumulated naturally over millennia in the ancient soils of Amazonia (see here and here) and in this part of Amazonia there is also a large amount of mercury that has been released by gold mining. Use of mercury is widespread as the cheapest way to separate the gold from the alluvial sediments, and mercury has been found at concentrations of 0.060-0.126 milligrams per liter in the water at the locations of these dams (see Forsberg, 2015, p. 35). Mercury concentrations increase through bioconcentration as it is passed up the food chain, with the concentration rising by about a factor of ten with each link in the chain. Predatory fish such as tucunaré (Cichla ocelaris), which often dominates in Amazonian reservoirs, are at the top of the aquatic food chain, and humans provide the next link. This results in human populations near reservoirs having dangerously high concentrations in their bodies (see here, here and here).The Brazilian government’s move to initiate preparations for these three dams bodes ill for the Amazon in many ways. Brazil’s 2050 National Energy Plan and the ten-year plans contain ominous passages suggesting that there would be a great expansion of dams in addition to those currently listed for construction if dams in Indigenous areas and conservation units (protected areas for biodiversity) are allowed. The Tapajós Basin is the scene of plans for 30 large dams, including the three that are now to be prepared.The impacts of Amazon dams have routinely been grossly understated in the environmental impact assessments used in the licensing process. These dams also fail to justify themselves on purely monetary grounds (see here and here). This is a global phenomenon, as shown by a world-wide study of existing dams. Brazil is fortunate to have much better options, including not exporting electricity in the form of aluminum and other electro-intensive commodities, and developing the countries enormous potential for wind and solar power (see here, here, here, here and here).ELETRONORTE stated to the newspaper O Estado de São Paulo that “all the projects are technically viable and would bring great gains to the Brazilian population, as they are clean, renewable energy projects with a potentially lower cost than other generation sources.” For the reasons explained in the studies cited above, this author contests all of these claims.This text is translated and expanded from the author’s column on the Amazônia Real website."
COVID: India's indigenous communities overcoming vaccine hesitancy,"Papli Bai vehemently refused to take the first vaccine shot against COVID-19 during the devastating second wave that hit India in April last year.She, like many others in the Garasiya tribal community, believed it was the injection that was causing people to fall sick and, in some cases, die.Distrustful of vaccines""I shouted at the health workers who came to our village. The male folk threw stones at them to shoo them away,"" Papli, 32, told DW.In another block near Abu Road, where the indigenous community lives, Keli Bai and her sister, Puli, shut their doors on medical health officials and workers. They refused to come out despite the pleas.Fear of syringes in the community is a mixture of mistrust and faith in the traditional medicinal rituals the tribe follows.For as long as they can remember, the Garasiya tribal community, considered to be the third largest tribal group in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, has had a deadly fear of syringes.This has had an enormous impact on the immunization of pregnant women and infants.Vaccine-hesitancy among the Garasiya tribal community predates the coronavirus pandemicDuring the pandemic, vaccine coverage was slow to take off. Medical workers said the tribal regions were seen as a closed community and, in many ways, unapproachable.""It was not just challenging for us but an uphill task to convince the community that COVID was indeed to be feared and protection was important,"" Richa Audichya of Jan Chetna Sansthan, an NGO that works with the Garasiyas, told DW.""It took us almost four months just to get an audience with them and explain what the disease was about,"" Audichya added.Tribes lack educationRajasthan is home to more than 82 million people and is predominantly rural, with nearly 75% of its population living in villages. Many indigenous tribes are settled in its southern region, where communities like the Bhil, Meena and Garasiya have made their place in the Aravalli foothills. They comprise nearly 14% of the state's population.Their livelihoods depend mainly on farming and some work as daily wage labor in nearby towns.The Garasiyas typically live in one-room houses made with mud and bamboo walls. Those with more money build flat tiled roofs, while the poorer people still use thatch.Getting tribal people to overcome inhibitions and accept immunization as the way forward has not been easy. Medical workers along with NGOs have sought the help of community workers and faith healers called ""bhopas"" to convince the Garasiya community.""They are not well-educated and depend on local medicine men and healers for their ailments. But I traveled a lot, especially in the interior areas to warn them of the pandemic and how this is a global disease,"" Gagan Giri, a faith healer, told DW.Women leaders help change minds on vaccinesConspiracy theories that were rife in indigenous communities in many parts of the India, such as the fear that vaccination affects fertility among women and makes men sterile, were also prevalent among the Garasiyas.In March 2021, India led the world in COVID-19 case numbers and deaths""Some of the women tribal members wanted sworn affidavits pledging money to the family if anything went amiss or if they fell sick. That was the level of distrust,"" social worker Chandrakantha told DW.But it was the involvement of the women leaders in the community, especially those who were elected leaders, that tipped the scales and led to the community toward finally agreeing to accept the vaccine.Sarmi Bai, 50, a former village head in Rajasthan's Sirohi district, played a pioneering role in spreading awareness about the vaccine in the face of overwhelming resistance.""I started with my village and told the women that COVID would kill us if we have no protection. What started in twos and threes of them getting jabs, began to spread and within a few months the campaign picked up,"" Sarmi told DW.It is not the first time Sarmi has worked with other village leaders on this kind of project. In 2010, she met former US President Barack Obama as part of the Hunger Project, which works with elected women in village councils.Women leading by example""I had to take my injection in front of many of my tribe members for them to convinced. I came back to them regularly to ensure that it would not have any impact on health,"" Lalitha Garasiya, 39, another village head told DW.She volunteered to be the first person in her village to get the shot to disprove the rumors.Another method employed by the women tribal members, who took the lead in persuading others take the COVID-19 vaccine, was through dancing and songs in the local dialect.They moved around villages, some of them located in far-flung hills, to spread the word of the importance of immunization and other measures to lower the risk of catching coronavirus.""I had to make my song as informative as possible and tell them about the dangers of COVID. It somehow struck a chord among the villagers and mindsets began to change,"" Navli Garasiya, a community leader, told DW.The landscape and lack of sufficient infrastructure hindered access to Rajasthan's rural villagesAccording to government official records, the vaccination drive among the tribal communities has been a success with 75% of the population now vaccinated. This is much higher than the level before the multiple interventions were employed.Today, routine immunization has picked up and vaccine coverage is making steady progress.Even in the central state of Chhattisgarh, despite vaccine hesitancy and inaccessibility, a push by a collective of NGOs, local networks and health volunteers helped the vaccine drive and convinced tribal members to accept the shots.""It's a miracle. How this community has transformed and come to believe that immunization is helpful will always be a cherished memory. To say it was challenging is putting it mildly,"" Vivek Joshi, medical officer for the Sirohi district, told DW.Edited by: Alex Berry"
"As the BJP absorbs the Tipra People’s Front, it hopes to capture the tribal vote","On March 20, Patal Kanya Jamatia joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in the presence of Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb. With that, the party she heads, the Tipra People’s Front, effectively merged with the BJP.As she joined the BJP, Jamatia batted for “greater Thansa [unity]” between tribal and non-tribal populations in the state, and an end to the “communal line of politics” that threatened to divide Tripura. In the interests of “peaceful co-existence”, Jamatia said, she was prepared to give up on aspirations for a separate tribal homeland carved out of Tripura, a long-running demand that had spawned decades of militancy.Jamatia expressed the hope that there would be a “four-engine BJP government” in Tripura. The party was already in power at the state and central levels. She hoped it would also be in power in the tribal autonomous council in Tripura as well as the village councils.Jamatia also described Deb as the “first honest Tripura CM”, who had tried to work towards “development for all”.It was a marked change of direction for Jamatia, who, just a few years ago, had called Deb an “illegal Bangladeshi immigrant”. It is also the first time that the BJP in Tripura has absorbed a tribal party into its ranks. It will need to balance tribal demands with the demands of its Bengali Hindu votebank in Tripura.Twipra vs TripuraTraditionally, the defining faultline in Tripura politics has divided the tribal community and the state’s non-tribal population, most of whom are Bengalis who settled in the state through several waves of migration. It has kept alive fears among the tribal community that they would be “swamped” by non-tribal populations.In the 1970s, the tribal demand for Tipraland, a separate ethnic homeland, led to an armed movement for self-determination. The Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council Act was passed in 1979, covering areas with predominantly tribal populations. The council was later granted powers under the Sixth Schedule, which provides for decentralised governance in tribal areas of Tripura, Assam, Mizoram and Meghalaya. The tribal council covers about two-thirds of Tripura’s territory.The creation of the council, however, did not quell the movement for self-determination. While the armed movement has largely died out, several political parties claiming to represent tribal interests in the state continue to demand a separate ethnic homeland.Ahead of the 2018 assembly elections, the Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura had campaigned aggressively for the separate state of Twipraland, consisting of the tribal council areas, and won eight seats that year.Last year, the Tipraha Indigenous Progressive Regional Alliance, or Tipra Motha, swept the autonomous district council elections. The party seeks to establish a “Greater Tipraland” – that is, a separate state consisting of the council areas and bodies to ensure the rights of tribal communities living outside council areas.The Tipra Motha was floated by Pradyot Kishore Manikya Debbarma, scion of the Tripura royal family, after he left the Congress in 2019. It has absorbed other tribal parties in the state and emerged as the main representative of tribal politics, in opposition to the BJP.Tripura People’s Front merged with BJP. Thousands of TPF workers joined BJP alongwith TPF President Patal Kanya Jamatia. pic.twitter.com/XBwRxOQtYl — News Arena (@NewsArenaIndia) March 20, 2022Vying for the tribal voteThe tribal vote is important for any party wishing to stay in power in the state. Twenty of the 60 assembly seats are reserved seats for communities defined as indigenous to the region. In 15 other seats, tribal populations can swing electoral results.The BJP, which won the 2018 assembly elections and formed government for the first time in Tripura, tried to navigate this electoral dynamic by tying up with the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura. But it has always been an uneasy alliance, given the tribal party’s demand for a separate state and the BJP’s reluctance to accede to it.On March 22, tribal welfare minister and Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura leader Mevar Kumar Jamatia told the state assembly that unequal development between the hills and the plains was fuelling the demand for a separate state.The tribal party is said to be toying with the idea of allying or merging with the Tipra Motha. But party spokesperson Mangal Debbarma denied such plans to Scroll.in.“Since 2009 we have been demanding Tripraland,” he said. “We are working towards achieving it. We will not need the support of Tripra Motha.”Still, the BJP is looking for new tribal faces and allies.A veteran journalist in the state told Scroll.in that Jamatia joining the BJP would “certainly give a boost” to the saffron party, given her influence in some pockets of the state. “The BJP has realised that Pradyot is posing a real challenge,” said the journalist.Gautam Chakma, a political scientist who teaches at Tripura University, told Scroll.in that the success of the Tipra Motha had made the BJP and the Indigenous People’s Front nervous.“IPFT and CPI(M) [the Communist Party of India (Marxist)], which were once strong in the tribal areas, are also losing their ground slowly,” said Chakma.“Since Tripura Motha is rising very fast, people are now thinking that the future is bright for [the party] and tribals across classes are supporting it,” he said.A ‘u-turn’Notably, Jamatia joined the BJP after the Tipra Motha held a massive rally in Agartala on March 12, demanding a separate state for tribals. Debbarma made a fresh “call for unity” among all the tribal communities to achieve the goal of a “Greater Tipraland”.Debbarma called Jamatia’s decision to join the BJP a “U-turn”. In the past, Jamatia had opposed the Citizenship Amendment Act – which is one of the BJP’s main promises to the state’s Bengali Hindu population. The CAA fast-tracks Indian citizenship for non-Muslim migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. It had led to tribal parties accusing the BJP of enabling “illegal immigration” into the state.Jamatia filed a plea in the Supreme Court alleging extensive illegal immigration, and sought the detention, identification and deportation of such migrants.She had also asked for a National Register of Citizens for Tripura, on the same lines as Assam’s NRC, which apparently set out to sift “genuine” Indians from “illegal immigrants” living in the state. Anyone who could not prove that they or their ancestors had entered Assam before March 1971 – the start of the Bangladesh War, which had triggered a fresh wave of migration from across the border – would be considered an “illegal immigrant” liable to losing citizenship rights.Jamatia, in her petition, said the cut-off date for Tripura should be July 19, 1948, the date on which India closed its western borders to Pakistan – the eastern border saw a more long-drawn population exchange. After she joined the BJP, Jamatia reiterated her demand for an NRC but was silent on the CAA.Debbarma pointed out that after she joined the BJP, Patal Kanya reiterated her demand for an NRC but was silent on the CAA. “Which means that they just want to throw people from one particular religion,” said Debbarma. “I want NRC but I also oppose CAA.”He was referring to the idea that the NRC was aimed at ejecting all “illegal immigrants”, both Hindu and Muslim, while the CAA would ensure Hindu migrants a path to citizenship.“People are not so foolish and can see through the hypocrisy,” Debbarma said.He added that unless the demand for “Greater Tipraland” was included as a written precondition, there was no question of the Tipra Motha allying with any other regional or national party before the assembly elections of 2023.“We are fighting for our [tribal] constitutional rights,” he said. “People will answer in 2023 who has worked for the tribals. They already gave the indication in last year’s ADC [autonomous district council] election.”We TIPRA motha held a #greatertipraland awareness campaign pic.twitter.com/JnS5U0dRfa — Swapan Kumar Tripura (@SwapanTri5) March 27, 2022The BJP’s balancing actThe BJP had used the Citizenship Amendment Bill to woo the state’s majority Bengali Hindu vote in the assembly elections of 2018 and the general elections of 2019.But 10 of the BJP members of the legislative assembly – two of whom are ministers – belong to tribal communities. Both members of Parliament from Tripura belong to the BJP. Of them, Rebati Tripura belongs to the state’s main tribal community.He called Jamatia joining the party a “positive development”, since she had significant support in three constituencies.“More tribal leaders are joining BJP,” said Rebati Tripura, who is also former head of the BJP’s Scheduled Tribe Morcha in Tripura. “We work hard with our slogan, ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ – our party is taking along people belonging to all castes, creeds and religions.”He criticised Debbarma’s “Greater Tipraland” demand, claiming that the royal scion’s only aim was to gain political mileage before the 2023 assembly elections. “Pradyot is not giving any challenge to the BJP, in fact, he wants to work with the BJP,” said Rebati Tripura. “He is fooling the Tiprasa people in the name of Greater Tipraland.”According to the BJP parliamentarian, it was difficult to divide tribal and non-tribal areas of the state. “It is not easy to break Tripura into two states,” he said “We know the tiprasa [the main tribal community] are deprived in the health, and education sectors. We have to ensure development by keeping one Tripura.”Veteran journalist and political commentator Swapan Bhattacharya told Scroll.in that Jamatia joining the BJP would not stop the rise of the Tipra Motha.“In the 2018 election, IPFT came to power with BJP, but they did not do anything for the tribal people,” said Bhattacharya. “Even though RSS made a strong organisation for their brother party, BJP, they [the BJP-IPFT alliance] ignored the tribal issues after coming into power.”Debbarma had filled the vacuum and his party would be a deciding factor in the next elections, Bhattacharya felt."
Why Australia’s Indigenous People Fear the Police,"Protesters march in Sydney, Saturday, June 6, 2020, to support the movement of U.S. protests over the death of George Floyd. Black Lives Matter protests across Australia saw thousands of demonstrators in state capitals honor the memory of George Floyd and protest the deaths of Indigenous Australians in custody.AdvertisementMarch 21 was the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which marks the anniversary of a horrific massacre in apartheid South Africa in 1960, in which 69 innocent civilians were killed whilst protesting in Sharpeville. It is a widely recognized day that seeks to shape a more equal world, free from discrimination.In Australia however, March 21 is only known as Harmony Day. Some in the media have argued that this is because acknowledging “the elimination of racial discrimination” would actually mean accepting its presence in the first place.When it comes to the Australian justice system, the prevalence of systemic racism is hard to ignore. Cheryl Axleby, co-chair of Indigenous justice group Change the Record, is blunt in saying that the justice system openly discriminates against Indigenous people.“Every year, Aboriginal people suffer racist or violent mistreatment and abuse by police,” Axleby, a Narungga woman, told The Diplomat. “They don’t report it for fear of reprisal. For those who do, complaints often take months, sometimes even over a year, to be investigated and resolved.”Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.

A large, sprawling, and isolated expanse at the top of Australia, the NT contains just over 1 percent of the Australian population. Of its 230,000 inhabitants, the majority live in the port city of Darwin.Whilst the Indigenous population in Australia sits at below 3 percent of the total, in the NT, members of the world’s oldest civilization make up just over 25 percent of residents. It is no coincidence that the NT is also home to some of the most gruesome parts of Australia’s bloody history.Guardian Australia recently published “The Killing Times,” an interactive map documenting the deaths of Indigenous people at the hand of Australian settlers. Dotted throughout the Northern Territory are tales of murder. In 1924, 20 Indigenous people were murdered for unknown reasons in the Victoria River District. A survivor later told of how his people “were run down and shot like dogs.”AdvertisementFour years later, at Coniston, a “reprisal” by colonizers left up to 200 Indigenous people dead. Many Warlpiri and Yanmatjiri Aboriginal people were hunted down and murdered by police expeditions.These incidents aren’t isolated in Australia’s history, but form a pattern that continues to repeat today. In 1991, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC) was deemed to be a landmark moment in the relationship between Indigenous Australians and the justice system, but since that time, over 500 Aboriginal people have died while in custody. No one has been found guilty or faced prison time over these deaths.Axleby is devastated by this. “It is hard to feel justice,” she told The Diplomat, “when time and time again Aboriginal people are killed in custody, but no one is held accountable.”One Indigenous person, who requested not to be named, noted that an inherent fear of the police has been ingrained into many in the Northern Territory.“I don’t talk to the cops, it’s a very scary thing to do,” she told The Diplomat. “I avoid it all costs. Even my children are afraid of the police.”She noted that police are often stationed at liquor stores, checking the IDs of Indigenous patrons and subjecting them to further questions, sometimes including their address. All of this results in an ingrained anxiety.Cases like the recent trial of Zachary Rolfe, which ended with the police officer being acquitted for the murder of an Indigenous teenager, have emphasized to people like Cheryl Axleby the stark contrast in justice for police as opposed to Indigenous people.Enjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.When an Indigenous person dies, “too often findings are ‘inconclusive’ due to insufficient evidence.” But at the same time, “Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who are the victims of police misconduct face huge barriers to justice.”Another Indigenous activist told The Diplomat that “our people have always been criminalized because of the color of our skin.”The reality of the systemic racism faced by Indigenous people in the justice system is highlighted by former Chief Justice of Western Australia, the Hon. Wayne Martin AC:AdvertisementAboriginal people are much more likely to be questioned by police than non-Aboriginal people. When questioned they are more likely to be arrested. If they are arrested, they are much more likely to be remanded in custody than given bail. Aboriginal people are much more likely to plead guilty than go to trial, and if they go to trial, they are much more likely to be convicted. If convicted, they are much more likely to be imprisoned than non-Aboriginal people, and at the end of their term of imprisonment they are much less likely to get parole than non-Aboriginal people.Is Change Happening?In 2008, the Australian government released a framework, titled “Closing the Gap.” The report alluded to the large discrepancies in key factors such as life expectancy, incarceration rates, and health issues between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.This year, the Law Council to Australia released a statement clarifying that a lot of these aspirations had yet to be fulfilled.“It is now more important than ever to grapple with what Closing the Gap will mean in practice,” said Law Council of Australia President Tass Liveris. “Because whether as accused people, offenders or victims, outcomes for First Nations peoples in the criminal justice context clearly continue to worsen.”It is widely accepted that the forced removal of children from their families, under a government-mandated movement now known as “The Stolen Generation,” has resulted in long-lasting trauma, which has heavily contributed to Indigenous over-representation in the Australian prison system.In the Northern Territory, home to the highest percentage of prisoners in the country, Aboriginal people make up 84 percent of the inmates, despite representing around a quarter of the total population in the state. One of the key recommendations from the RCIADIC was that the dramatic and unique trauma that was inflicted on the Indigenous population needed to be taken into account when sentencing.Too often, this simply isn’t done. The Law Council of Australia has implored the federal government to work with First Nations groups directly to progress reforms such as Closing the Gap, noting that currently the plight of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the justice system “is a national tragedy.”Any progress has been notoriously slow, however, and is often mired in debates around merit.The Uluru Statement from the Heart, a campaign led by many prominent Indigenous leaders, has called for a dedicated Aboriginal voice in Parliament. They say this will allow the first people on the land to have a direct, political say in the way Aboriginal people are supported in the various communities. Laws that directly and often only impact Aboriginal people would, for the first time, be reviewed and recommendations given by a dedicated Aboriginal representative. “We seek constitutional reforms to empower our people and take a rightful place in our own country,” the statement said.Such a reform, however, has been consistently opposed by most members of the current government.Change the Record has called for more funding for Indigenous health care groups, especially for Indigenous women, who are 32 times more likely to than non-Indigenous women to be hospitalized as a result of domestic violence.AdvertisementEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.Change the Record’s report made 12 recommendations, including an Indigenous research group to look at systemic racism in health systems.Other recommendations included an increase in the welfare rate, which was refused by the federal government, and more access to housing, with overcrowding becoming a serious issue throughout the country.Sadly, most of these changes have not been implemented. And to many activists, the limited reforms that have been made do not have any lasting impact on the everyday safety of ordinary Indigenous people.For Cheryl Axleby, real change needs to come from the top and be universal. “Governments need to start addressing the underlying drivers of inequality and injustice in our communities instead of just throwing money at police to respond,” she said.When asked why there doesn’t seem to be much tangible change, she doesn’t mince her words: “There is still not the political will or leadership to end the injustice, discrimination, and disadvantage that hurts our people.”Until this happens, discrimination and injustice will continue unabated for many of Australia’s original inhabitants."
Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT) to discuss possibility of merging with Tripura Indigenous Progressive Regional Alliance Motha,"The Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT), an ally of the ruling BJP in the North-eastern state, on Sunday said it would discuss the possibility of merging or allying with the Tripura Indigenous Progressive Regional Alliance (TIPRA Motha) before the assembly elections due early next year.The TIPRA Motha, headed by royal scion Pradyot Kishore Debbarma, seeks a separate state for the indigenous people of Tripura.“Our conference to form a new executive committee will be held on April 2 and 3. There we would discuss whether the IPFT should merge or forge an alliance with TIPRA Motha as both parties demand a separate state,” IPFT spokesperson and assistant general secretary Mangal Debbarma told PTI.TIPRA Motha chief Pradyot Kishore Debbarma has several times called upon all tribal-based parties of the state to unite to fulfil the Greater Tipraland demand.The TIPRA Motha, formed early last year, swept the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) elections held in April 2021, winning 18 of the 28 seats over the ‘Greater Tipraland’ demand in a direct contest with the ruling BJP-IPFT alliance.The TTAADC comprises two-thirds of Tripura’s territory and is home to the tribals who constitute a third of the state’s estimated 40 lakh population.The IPFT spokesperson said when the “popular” royal scion has given a call for unity of tribal parties, “we want to give him a chance for fulfilling his demand for a separate state for indigenous people of the state”.In the 60-member Tripura Assembly, the demand for a separate state may influence results in 20 seats where tribal people hold considerable sway.‘Greater Tipraland’ is an extension of the IPFT’s demand for ‘Tipraland’, a separate state for tribals by carving out the TTAADC area.The proposed ‘Greater Tipraland’ state would include tribal majority areas of Tripura, Assam, Mizoram, and even Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh.“It is a fact that a majority of our young generation support the separate statehood demand because of unequal development in hills and plains. Even after 74 years of Independence, the disparity continues to exist. The younger generation wants social and economic development,” Tripura Tribal Welfare Minister and IPFT general secretary Mevar Kumar Jamatiya said in the Assembly on March 22.Most of the state’s tribal population live in the hills while plain areas are inhabited by non-tribals.The party wants the Centre to discuss its demand but has not received any response so far. All major political parties in the state including the ruling BJP, opposition CPI(M) and the Congress have rejected the demand calling it “separatist and divisive”."
Budget ignores Indigenous people: Greens,"news, nationalThe Australian Greens have criticised the federal budget for backing billionaires and corporations while failing Indigenous communities. Greens Senator Dorinda Cox labelled the budget a ""last-ditch play for votes"" that failed to address cost-of-living pressures, with the government having been ""sold to the highest bidder"". ""This budget gives $37.6 billion in fossil fuel subsidies of taxpayer money that will go directly into the profits of the massive corporations that bankroll the Liberal Party's coffers,"" she said. ""But when you read the budget, it's clear that they can't keep people safe and they can't manage the economy. They are selling us out. ""This is another budget for the billionaires and the big corporations."" Among the headlines from the budget are a one-off $420 payment to more than 10 million Australians earning up to $126,000 a year, while the government will also halve the fuel excise to 22.1 cents for the next six months. Senator Cox on Wednesday became the first Indigenous woman to deliver the Greens' post-budget reply. She said Prime Minister Scott Morrison was ""hell bent on destroying country, the land, skies, and waters that First Nations people have cared for and sustained for generations"". The WA senator lashed the government for failing the children and future generations of Indigenous communities. ""Our people are dying in custody, there is no treaty with the First Nations people - only band-aid solutions from a government with no real vision for the future,"" she said. ""Your taxes are paying to destroy our cultural heritage - shame."" Tuesday's federal budget confirmed $1 billion to protect the Great Barrier Reef, along with funding for research and recycling programs as part of an overall $2.3 billion sector spend.

University of Helsinki: Indigenous peoples possess a great deal of knowledge on the prevention of biodiversity loss,"In Brazil, there are more than 300 Indigenous peoples. In her work, Associate Professor of Indigenous Studies Pirjo Kristiina Virtanen has been worked particularly with the Apurina and Manchineri peoples that belong to the Arawakan language group.Many studies have shown that biodiversity is at its richest in the world precisely in regions populated by Indigenous peoples. According to Virtanen, the actors of ‘nature’ are considered to have personhood in the Amazon, and interactively communicated with. In other words, ‘nature’ is not seen as something separate from people and social relationships.“They perceive biodiversity loss as the disappearance of many animals and plants resulting from dominant society’s unsustainable values and actions,” Virtanen says.Humans must consume natural resources in a sustainable manner, making it possible for the environment to guarantee their health and wellbeing. Consequently, the activities of non-Indigenous economic operators, such as the polluting mining industry, infrastructure constructors and large scale agriculture, are not in a reciprocal relationship with Amazonian nature.According to Virtanen, there is great variance between how the Indigenous people of the region talk about environmental matters in their communities in their native languages and how they address them at political events in the language of the majority population.“That’s because they have a totally different environmental philosophy. Also, by using the language of the majority of the population, they make things understandable to outsiders. This is why they use the Portuguese word for nature in their petitions, even though such a word does not even exist in their own language,” Virtanen says.Amazonian Indigenous peoples strive to prevent biodiversity loss and promote biodiversity through a range of political measures, petitions, social media, research and collaboration with other parties at many different levels.“On their own land, many peoples also make a lot of different community plans and decisions on, for example, which species can be fished and hunted at specific times and in specific areas. There is discussion on the sufficiency of various natural resources, and younger generations are taught to protect certain areas and species according to changing circumstances.”Pursuing advancement is not essentialIn addition to Finland, the Sámi homeland is composed of the northernmost parts of the Kola Peninsula, Sweden and Norway, and differences are engendered by both local lifestyles and cultures as well as the varying rights of Indigenous peoples and Sámi policies.According to Hanna Guttorm, a researcher specialising in Indigenous studies, the idea of pursuing advancement has not really been part of traditional Sámi philosophy. The Sámi culture emphasises survival and well-(enough-)being (‘birgejupmi’) together with the environment, animals and other people in a way that preserves the preconditions of life and sustenance, also for the next winter.“This means taking care of the carrying capacity of the surrounding land and waterways, and looking after them among the local communities,” Guttorm notes.“Traditional knowhow such as this still resides in the oldest generations and those living close to nature, but some of it has become unnecessary due to technological advances.In the Sámi languages, the word ‘nature’ has become part of the vocabulary with partially the same meaning as in Finnish, but several words related more specifically to the use and meaning of various types of land are used alongside it.”Discussion on the climate and on biodiversity loss centres on reindeer husbandryReindeer husbandry is the most vibrant, extensive and best-subsidised of all Sámi livelihoods, which is why most of the climate change discussions concerning Sámi are focused on it, especially in Finland. Mechanisation and the necessity of supplementary feeding due to difficult winter conditions brought about by climate change, as well as the associated additional costs, have led to increases in the number of reindeer herded, even exceeding the capacity of the environment.“Research has shown that the traditional ecological knowledge of the Sámi people is often ignored,” Guttorm says.According to Guttorm, current Sámi policy discussions emphasise the rights of the Indigenous people to traditional livelihoods.“Unfortunately, even the Sámi appear to consign biodiversity to the sidelines in these discussions. It is why I think that Sámi should awaken to the worry about biodiversity loss and revitalise more widely the traditional knowledge of living in balance with nature. Participation and reciprocity also entail responsibility, which may be overlooked if the emphasis is on adaptation to climate change only.”Prejudices must be overcomePirjo Kristiina Virtanen and Hanna Guttorm are happy that the unsustainable human-centred view dominant in the Western world, of humans being above nature and its rulers, has begun to crumble. Indigenous studies, posthumanism and a more comprehensive study of networks are examples of new trends related to this development.“Indigenous peoples’ views emphasise relationships. They focus on the relationships between various beings, humans, animals, plants and the Earth. Moreover, the Indigenous peoples of the Amazon educate even the youngest members of their community to listen to and observe the environment. A special relationship with nature is a reality, not a myth. The interconnectedness of humans and the environment is evidenced in languages and practices,” Virtanen says.Rani-Henrik Andersson, who studies the Indigenous peoples in North America, shares this view of nature.“Fortunately, the romantic stereotype of Indigenous peoples who have a magical connection with nature has, in recent years, been replaced by a more in-depth understanding and respect for their connection to nature,” Andersson notes.Nature can have religious, practical or economic significance, or all of the above.According to both Andersson as well as Virtanen and Guttorm, Indigenous peoples do not in practice separate humans from nature and the environment; rather, humans are an integral part of them. Both worlds belong to the same individually and communally experienced sphere of knowledge, which is discussed and from which lessons are drawn through experience.“Indigenous peoples investigate and perceive the environment from an ecological perspective, and their knowledge of the ecosystem is inseparably linked to their belief systems and, consequently, their traditional knowledge or traditional ecological knowledge,” Andersson says.Ecological knowledge must be utilisedVirtanen finds it sad that there are a number of Indigenous peoples in the Amazon rainforest whose land is under pressure from, among other things, l agribusiness. For this reason, they have often had to choose an unsustainable livelihood, because it is the only way to earn money for food that the environment can no longer produce.In these regions, the continuation of native languages and ecological knowledge poses another challenge. Both are important for building a more sustainable future.“For instance, the Apurinã nation lives in almost 30 different reservations, and this is evident in the regions they inhabit. The Apurinã regions with the least number of non-sustainable external economic projects also have the strongest cultural knowledge and an Indigenous language that expresses the world in a substantially different way from Portuguese.”According to Virtanen, the concept of a ‘noble savage’ is prevalent. It is often thought that the Indigenous peoples of the Amazon live without, for example, modern technology, but for them too, urban living and studying at university are an important part of defending the values and rights of Indigenous peoples.According to the researchers, the biggest difference between the majority of the population and Indigenous peoples is precisely their values. The ecological knowledge and skills of Indigenous peoples should also be put to use in efforts to curb biodiversity loss.Indigenous peoples of North America take a strong stanceAccording to Andersson, North American Indigenous peoples and their traditional knowledge have been overlooked in the discussion on the environment and its conservation.“Only in recent years has their voices been better heard and their notion of the environment based on local traditional knowledge begun to be taken seriously in the discourses of both academic research and nature conservation,” says Andersson.Climate change affects the lives of Indigenous peoples from the Arctic to California. In the Arctic region, the climate is warming, the ice is melting and the sea water is heating up. This has marked effects on, among other things, hunting and fishing, while melting ice and permafrost are exposing large reserves of natural gas and oil pursued by big business.“In fact, this is one of the significant issues that Indigenous peoples across North America are engaging with actively. They have organised extensive demonstrations against large energy companies and their oil and gas pipelines.”At the same time, the western parts of North America are suffering from the worst drought in more than a thousand years, resulting in extensive forest fires becoming an annually occurring phenomenon.“Drought affects the livelihoods of the region at the same time as declining water resources are used for the growing needs of large cities such as Las Vegas. In this too, Indigenous peoples actively contribute to identifying solutions that can be used to, for example, conduct the tourism industry on a sustainable basis.”Activity through organisationsAlongside civic activity, many Indigenous peoples have been active in a range of national and international organisations whose goals include the transition from the use of fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources.For example, wind and solar power plants have been built in many reservations, which can play a significant role at the local level, as well as in terms of the self-sufficiency of the reservations. Independently generated energy reduces dependence on the federal energy systems that rely on fossil fuels.Many peoples are also involved in the activities of authorities responsible for national parks and other conservation organisations. On the California coast, for example, the Chumash people collaborate with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States to protect the Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary. The action plan for the region extensively encompasses the traditional ecological knowledge of the Chumash.Indigenous peoples strive to take a strong stance on environmental issues at the local, national and international levels, and they are increasingly listened to."
Indigenous-led report warns against ‘simplistic take on conservation’,"To deal with climate change and biodiversity loss effectively and equitably, conservation needs to adopt a human rights-based approach, according to a new report co-authored by Indigenous and community organizations across Asia.Unlike spatial conservation targets such as “30 by 30,” a rights-based approach would recognize the ways in which Indigenous people lead local conservation efforts, and prioritize their tenure rights in measuring conservation success.Without tenure rights, strict spatial conservation targets could lead to human rights abuses, widespread evictions of Indigenous communities across Asia, and high resettlement costs, the report warned.Also without tenure rights, the inflow of money into nature-based solutions such as carbon offsets and REDD+ projects could also result in massive land grabs instead of benefiting local communities.Conservation needs to adopt a human-rights based approach to deal effectively and equitably with the twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, according to a new report co-authored by more than 20 Indigenous and community organizations across Asia.The report, published by the NGO Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI) in February, says that without meaningful consultation of and participation by local communities, top-down conservation solutions such as “30 by 30” will only deepen inequalities while leading to the prosecution of Indigenous groups.The 30 by 30 plan, a proposal to conserve 30% of Earth’s land and sea areas by 2030 through “area-based conservation measures” like protected national parks, has seen a wave of support in recent years. But its emphasis on spatial targets has drawn skepticism and concern from some Indigenous leaders, who called it a “simplistic take on conservation” in the report.With country representatives set to gather and discuss the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework in China this coming May — of which the 30 by 30 plan is a cornerstone — the proposal and its focus on spatial targets has increasingly come under the spotlight.“In an environment where identity and territorial rights are either not recognized or ignored,” the use of such targets “[raises] serious human rights concerns,” the report said.See related: New IPCC climate report stresses importance of Indigenous & local land rights 58 timesConservation ‘a nightmare for Indigenous people’Strict spatial targets that fail to consider Indigenous-led conservation have long contributed to human rights abuses against local communities, Rukka Sombolinggi, a leader at Indonesia’s Alliance of Indigenous Peoples of the Archipelago, one of the groups involved in the report, said at its virtual launch last month.“The word ‘conservation’ is a nightmare for Indigenous people,” she said, citing examples of WWF-supported park rangers in Central Africa and South Asia enforcing the boundaries of protected wildlife reserves through the torture, rape and murder of members of nearby communities.Such crimes are clear examples of conservation enforcement gone wrong. But even at their best, stringent spatial targets that exclude Indigenous people disparage their contributions to ecosystems and insidiously downplay their humanity, Rukka said. “Animals and plants are considered more important than humans, and Indigenous people are even considered as a threat,” she said.This is despite the contributions Indigenous groups make to conservation. Indigenous communities across the world invest nearly $5 billion in conservation annually, making up a quarter of all conservation spending by governments, donors, foundations and NGOs worldwide, according to the report. Their customary territories are estimated to contain 36% of the world’s remaining intact forest landscapes and 80% of remaining biodiversity.“Because of the deep connection of our people to our land and territories, we conserve an outsized proportion of the world’s biodiversity and ecosystems through our governance system and cultural practices,” Peter Kallang, an Indigenous leader from Sarawak, Malaysia, said at the launch. “Caring for and sustaining our territories is part of our identity, part of our customary laws and values, and part of our way of life.”At times, this has come at the cost of their lives. Since 2012, more than 1,540 land and environmental rights defenders have been killed, more than a quarter of them in Asia, according to human rights NGO Global Witness.A rights-based approach to conservationYet despite their contributions to conservation, Indigenous people often fail to secure a seat at the table when it comes to participation and decision-making in conservation.A history of colonialism and a tendency to favor Western forms of conservation without understanding the value of traditional Indigenous practices, are some of the impediments standing in the way of Indigenous-led conservation, the report said.The power imbalance also stems from a lack of Indigenous land rights. They may have a deep connection to their land, and defend it with their lives, but in Asia, only 8.7% of territories held by Indigenous people and local communities are legally recognized, the report found.A rights-based approach to conservation, as proposed in the report, would recognize the ways in which Indigenous people lead local conservation efforts, and prioritize their tenure rights in measuring conservation success.That would give communities more power to govern their land, instead of simply managing it, said Gam Shimray, a leader at the Thailand-based Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact, another group involved in the report.“Management involves action taken to complete objectives [or programs] already decided by those who have set the agenda,” he said. “When we talk about a rights-based approach … governance is what Indigenous peoples and local communities are talking about.“Who has the power to set the agenda? Who makes decisions regarding appropriate actions … who is participating, and being included in whose project?”There is evidence of Indigenous-led initiatives being more effective than programs run by external players, including local governments, NGOs and other private actors, Shimray added.A global analysis of 169 case studies from 1996 to 2019 cited by the report found the latter were 10 times more likely than the former to produce negative outcomes in both community well-being and conservation.Redistribute conservation funding to local communitiesIn Asia alone, more than 1 billion people currently live in protected areas, or areas of high biodiversity and conservation importance with potential to be converted into protected areas, the report estimated.Improperly implemented, spatial conservation targets such as those under the 30 by 30 proposal would lead to widespread evictions while exacting a financial toll: the price of resettling and compensating communities, and replacing their existing conservation programs, will likely cost countries between 100 and more than 1,000 times the price of recognizing their tenure rights, the report calculated.View all of Mongabay’s coverage of land rights issues here.As the planet warms, and interest in green finance grows, the emphasis on spatial conservation targets has also been accompanied by a burgeoning carbon commodity industry, and country-to-country payments for environmental services.Last year, leaders in Sabah, Malaysia signed a conservation agreement with a group of foreign companies involving more than 2 million hectares (4.9 million acres) of protected forest for carbon offsets.Civil society and Indigenous groups said negotiations did not meaningfully involve those living in and around the forests, raising concerns that without tenure rights, inflows of climate finance might not benefit local communities, but could result in massive land grabs instead.A more effective way to use this money, the report said, would be to redistribute current conservation funding to local organizations that would secure customary lands for communities, protect and monitor their rights, and help with capacity building.Since 2008, more than $4 billion has been pledged to multilateral climate funds to finance REDD+, a program in which industrialized nations make payments to tropical forest countries to curb deforestation and avoid the emissions released when trees are cut down, the report noted.A fraction of that, $535 million, would be sufficient to fund the three countries in Asia that currently have the capacity to map, delimitate, and title all Indigenous and community lands — India, Indonesia and Nepal — the report said.Banner image: Indigenous peoples in West Papua, Indonesia.

"Federal dental-care program cannot leave Indigenous communities behind, say advocates","Dr. Sheri McKinstry is optimistic that a new national dental program will offer much-needed access to dental care across the country, but she also says it's currently unclear how it will help improve oral health in remote Indigenous communities.""I can't see it making that big of a difference in the communities because a lot of it has to do with access and getting dentists and oral-health providers into the community,"" said McKinstry, a pediatric dentist and assistant professor in the College of Dentistry at the University of Saskatchewan.As part of a supply-and-confidence agreement between the Liberals and NDP, the federal government proposed a national dental care program for families making less than $90,000 per year.It's estimated that 6.5 million people in Canada will be eligible for the program. Starting later this year, children under 12 would become eligible for the program, with a full roll out by 2025 .An existing program, Non-insured health benefits for First Nations and Inuit (NIHB), provides coverage for dental care to eligible First Nations people and Inuit. But many communities lack the dentists and resources to access care, experts say.Dr. Sheri McKinstry says that without attention on access for Indigenous communities, a national dental-care program risks widening health equity gaps. (Submitted by Sheri McKinstry)Preventative oral health care is often overlooked as concerns like food and housing affordability — social determinants of health — take priority, McKinstry told Cross Country Checkup.""There are other things that become more important to survival and living and thriving than oral health and oral health seems to go by the wayside,"" she said.A 2019 York University study of dental health among Indigenous communities in Ontario found that more than a quarter of participants in the research only visited a dentist for emergencies.The auditor general of Canada reported in 2017 that First Nations and Inuit populations had nearly twice as much dental disease compared to non-Indigenous Canadians, due in part to fewer visits to a dentist, geographical barriers and poorer access to nutritious food.WATCH | What we know about the proposed federal dental-care plan:What we know about the Liberals’ proposed dental care program Duration 2:10 The federal Liberals are promising to introduce a dental care program for middle- and low-income Canadian families, under its confidence-and-supply agreement with the NDP. Officials expect the program will start later this year for kids under 12, with full implementation by 2025. 2:10Social issues contribute to poor oral health: SenatorSenator Mary Jane McCallum, who worked as a dental therapist in communities across northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan, says that the oral health situation continues to worsen in some remote Indigenous communities.""The number of unmet needs that are now in the communities will never, ever be able to be brought under control by just one dentist going in, even if they went in every week,"" said McCallum.She saw this first hand last year, when in response to the pandemic McCallum flew into northern Manitoba to provide dental care to a handful of students.Senator Mary Jane McCallum has worked in remote communities as a fly-in dentist. (Justin Tang/Canadian Press)Of the students she saw, three needed follow-up dental work after McCallum's treatment. Some patients were experiencing over-crowded housing, domestic violence and food insecurity, she said.That experience, she told Checkup, drove home to her the importance of addressing social needs that influence poor health.""It really showed me that this isn't only bacterial in origin. There are social issues here that continue to perpetuate the dental disease,"" said McCallum.As the federal government looks toward a national program, McCallum believes that such an approach must prioritize younger populations.""Target the children. They have no control, no influence over their lives. So be focused, work on that group and see how it works because you can just open it to everybody,"" she said.In a statement, a spokesperson for the Office of the Health Minister said ""the Liberal Party of Canada and Canada's New Democratic Party have agreed to work collaboratively in key policy areas, including expanding and protecting our health-care system.""Health Canada did not directly respond to a question from CBC Radio about whether a national program would prioritize access to dental care in remote Indigenous communities.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a supply-and-confidence agreement with the NDP last week. As part of the agreement, the Liberals will expand health care to include dental care. (The Canadian Press/Justin Tang)'Safety net' for those without coveragePrograms to improve dental care nationally should be considered through a health equity lens, McKinstry said.Health can be thought of as a ladder, with those on the top rungs enjoying far better support than those on the bottom rungs, she explained.A national dental-care program risks widening that gap, she said — and with many Indigenous communities already at a disadvantage, it's critical to consider the most vulnerable.""What we don't want to do is increase the health and inequity gap, which can actually happen if we're not taking indigenous people in the communities into consideration when we're rolling out this program.""Dr. Herenia Lawrence says that the federal program could provide a safety net for those not covered by existing Indigenous dental-care programs. (Jeff Comber/University of Toronto)Despite concerns about the plan's rollout, Herenia Lawrence, an associate professor in the faculty of dentistry at University of Toronto, says it could provide a ""safety net"" for Indigenous people not covered under the existing NIHB plan.The proposed program could also ""facilitate access to care for Indigenous peoples living off reserve in major urban centres who often struggle to find care,"" she said.Under the Liberals' supply-and-confidence agreement with the NDP, additional funds are also being earmarked for affordable housing , in particular housing for Indigenous communities.Efforts to address overcrowding on reserves could help reduce the barriers to accessing care, Lawrence said.""This would be a step towards addressing inequalities that can affect oral health and access to dental care as well,"" she told Checkup.Written by Jason Vermes."
Columbus Day Must Die: NH Dems Torpedo Indigenous Peoples Day,"The fallen Christopher Columbus statue outside the Minnesota State Capitol after a group led by American Indian Movement members tore it down on June 10, 2020. (CREDIT: Tony Webster/ Flickr)A compromise proposal to create an Indigenous People’s Day in New Hampshire was killed by state House Democrats earlier this month, who argued honoring Native Americans was not enough.Columbus Day, they insisted, must die.Democrats on the House Executive Departments and Administration Committee unanimously voted HB 1173 as inexpedient to legislate, rejecting the idea of leaving both Columbus Day and Indigenous People’s Day on the calendar.“I don’t entirely understand their opposition,” said Rep. Oliver Ford (R-Chester).Ford is one of the bill’s co-sponsors, which would have established an Indigenous Peoples’ Day on Aug. 9 to coincide with World Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Ford’s bill had nothing to do with the October Columbus Day holiday. That was not good enough for progressives who want to eliminate the celebrations for Christopher Columbus, he said.“I specifically think they are separate issues,” Ford said. “If he wasn’t a nice guy, then don’t celebrate a day for him. But don’t substitute it for another day.”The other co-sponsor, Rep. Jess Edwards (R-Auburn), said people on the left have been trying to do away with Columbus Day in the State House for years, and some members are burning out on the fight.“It’s an unpleasant issue,” Edwards said. “There are people who are advancing the bills who have so much anger and hostility against the United States. They use the Indigenous Peoples’ Day as a weapon.”Edwards said his bill was a response to a progressive effort last year to eliminate Columbus Day celebrations in New Hampshire in favor of Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Edwards sees Columbus Day as a celebration of this country’s discovery and attempts to end that celebration as un-American.“I’m a patriot. I love this country. Mankind is flawed, but the United States has done the greatest things on behalf of freedom in the world,” he said,Rep. Timothy Horrigan (D-Durham) opposed Edwards and Ford’s bill, saying holding the celebration in August is meaningless.“Aug. 9 is just another day,” Horrigan said.Horrigan wants to see New Hampshire stop celebrating Columbus Day in October and replace it with Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Horrigan bases his opinion on the historical record of the atrocities Columbus and his men committed in the New World.“A lot of good things came out of his voyage, but a lot of bad things came too,” Horrigan said. “According to the historical record, he was a pretty nasty guy.”However, the historical record also shows the residents of the New World weren’t perfect, either. Slavery, ritual human sacrifice, and cannibalism were all practiced by the indigenous people of the Americas long before Europeans arrived.When Columbus landed in the New World, he and his men started taking the native people as slaves, using them as forced labor, or selling them off to slaveholders in Spain.Concord, Manchester, Nashua, and other municipalities have adopted Indigenous Peoples’ Day celebrations to coincide with or replace the Columbus Day holidays. Last year, President Joe Biden became the first president to acknowledge Indigenous Peoples’ Day.Andrew Bullock, executive director at the Mt. Kearsarge Indian Museum in Warner, does not take a position on when it should happen but says he believes there should be a day to honor indigenous people in America. He would like to see the Columbus Day celebrations come to an end as well.“I don’t know that (Columbus Day celebrations) reflect the current native perspective in New Hampshire,” Bullock said.Controversy over Columbus Day is nothing new. Columbus was adopted as a patron for Catholic Italian immigrants in the 1880s. The Italians connected to Columbus as they sought to be accepted as Americans. In the 1920s, Columbus Day celebrations were at times violently opposed by the Ku Klux Klan because of the Klan’s hatred of Catholics.Sen. Lou D’Allesandro (D-Manchester) says he thinks it is great to have a day for indigenous people, but it can’t be Columbus Day.“I would be totally opposed to that,” D’Allesandro said. “Columbus Day has great meaning for Italian Americans who have done so much for this country.”D’Allesandro said the holiday is similar to St. Patrick’s Day for Irish Americans, a great way to celebrate both heritage and the American ideal.“Italians have done very many good things in this country and stood up for this country,” D’Allesandro said."
Chile's new president Gabriel Boric hears indigenous people's concerns on first day in office,"SANTIAGO: On his first day in office, Chile's president broke new ground by participating in a ceremony with indigenous peoples at the presidential palace before attending mass in Santiago's cathedral.Seated in the center of a circle in a courtyard at the presidential palace, Gabriel Boric and the First Lady, Irina Karamanos, listened one by one to concerns and wishes from representatives of seven indigenous tribes.""Generating intercultural work and a new relation between the government and indigenous peoples is vital to the construction of a just and dignified Chile,"" Boric, 36, tweeted after the ceremony.In a statement, the president's office said the ceremony ""is part of a new conception of the territory as plurinational where respect, dialogue and participation will be emphasized.""The representatives Boric met with came from the Yagan, Lican Antai, Mapuche Pewenche, Rapa Nui, Mapuche Lafkenche, Diaguita and Mapuche Futa Warria tribes.When he was sworn in on Friday, Boric broke with tradition by referring to indigenous Chileans, swearing to respect the Constitution before ""all Chilean peoples"" instead of just ""the Chilean people.""After the indigenous ceremony, Boric attended a Catholic mass at the Santiago cathedral with members of his cabinet -- noteworthy for having an average age of 42 and being composed of 14 women and 10 men.The transport and environment ministers also caused a buzz Saturday by arriving at the presidential palace via public transportation."
‘Fresh Banana Leaves‘ shows how conservation has harmed Indigenous people,"Fresh Banana LeavesJessica HernandezNorth Atlantic Books, $17.95During the civil war in El Salvador that began in the 1970s, an injured Victor Hernandez hid from falling bombs beneath the fronds of a banana tree. The child soldier, a member of the Maya Ch’orti’ group indigenous to the region, made a crutch from a branch of the tree and limped toward Guatemala, toward freedom. “I strongly believe that it was this banana tree that saved my life,” he told his daughter, Jessica Hernandez, who shares the story in Fresh Banana Leaves: Healing Indigenous Landscapes Through Indigenous Science. “It is ironic because banana trees are not native to El Salvador,” he said.Jessica Hernandez, an environmental scientist, draws parallels between her father’s story and that of the banana tree. The banana tree’s journey from Southeast Asia via colonial European ships forced the resilient plant to adapt to its new home in the Americas. Similarly, her father adjusted to being displaced, eventually settling in the United States, often experiencing less-than-warm welcomes along the way.Hernandez uses her father’s stories and other first-person accounts to frame a complex discussion on the interplay between colonialism, the displacement of Indigenous peoples, land degradation, and differences between how Western researchers and Indigenous people approach conservation. Western restoration can often focus on rooting out invasive species, Hernandez points out. But such a narrow focus, she contends, fails to understand that Indigenous people — the lands’ original stewards — are integral parts of imperiled landscapes.Sign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.Some researchers are now taking a community-based approach to conservation, in which Indigenous people participate in project planning instead of serving as study subjects. But this still doesn’t go far enough, Hernandez argues: In such studies, non-Indigenous people often end up speaking for Indigenous communities.Science News spoke with Hernandez about what she sees as conservation’s failures, Indigenous displacement and the connection between the two. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.SN: How do you use the term “Indigenous”?Hernandez: Somebody who still has their ancestral practices, their cultural traditions, their kinships with their people, whether they’re displaced or not, and are native to that region, or to that place that they can call home.SN: You write about how ecocolonialism — when non-Indigenous “settlers” govern Indigenous lands without consulting Indigenous people — can exacerbate climate change and result in Indigenous displacement and ecological grief. What is ecological grief?Hernandez: When I talk about ecological grief, I’m talking about the longing that many [displaced] Indigenous peoples have to return to their lands. Another way to look at that is the relationships that we [Indigenous people] have with nature — especially with our plants, animals and nonliving relatives. When the impacts of climate change destroy them, there’s a mourning that we all undergo as Indigenous peoples.A lot of settlers have lost their relationships with nature. They view nature as commodities without understanding that some of these natural resources mean something else to many people, aside from economic value.SN: You also write about how many non-Indigenous scientists practice helicopter research. How does this affect Indigenous communities?Hernandez: Helicopter research is when scientists come up with a question, but instead of building relationships with a community [whom the] question relates to, [they] just go to the community, collect the data and never come back.Oftentimes, we see how even some [Indigenous] knowledge is stolen. The example I brought up in the book is how a white man went to the Aboriginal community [in Australia], learned about “permaculture” [a type of self-sustaining farming system that requires minimal input from people, unlike labor-intensive, single-crop agriculture] and came back and was deemed a “founder.” Permaculture is something that you can get certified in, but not necessarily understand that it is Indigenous knowledge. Those funds [from certification courses] are not going to the Indigenous communities whose knowledge system was co-opted.Environmental scientist Jessica Hernandez is the author of Fresh Banana Leaves. Univ. of WashingtonSN: Are Western conservation efforts that are rooted in good intentions insufficient?Hernandez: I get a lot of pushback, especially when we are communities of color speaking up against conservation. We have to look at the impacts, and I think that a lot of the impacts tend to be negative — tend to be oppressive — toward communities of color. [Conservationists] tend to make all these protected areas in other countries, when in reality, they’re jeopardizing that local community’s livelihood. We see that with marine protected areas, where people who rely on fishing for sustenance are not allowed to fish. It also sometimes displaces many people because they have to leave their ancestral lands to find better economic opportunities.Conservation is very linear, focused on one species, and doesn’t necessarily look at the entire landscape. Look at the contributors of why a certain species is declining, and sometimes it’s not even that people are overharvesting — it’s climate change and other environmental impacts we tend to ignore.SN: How can conservationists center Indigenous people in their approaches?Hernandez: Invite them to the table or let them lead their own table. Indigenous peoples know their lands, know their environments, know some of the changes resulting from climate change. When you’re connected to your environment, you know best how to approach it. Conservationists should include Indigenous peoples as stakeholders, as opposed to always focusing on governments as the stakeholders.SN: Aside from the general public, who should read this book?Hernandez: [Conservation] professionals. People take actions once they start reflecting on how something that they uphold — like the field of conservation — can cause harm.Buy Fresh Banana Leaves from Bookshop.org.

Indigenous communities fighting to save rainforests say they have a plan to bring back lost nature,"Indigenous tribes who live at the mercy of climate change have made extraordinary efforts to save the planet using their ancient traditions, something that experts argue is largely ignored by modern science.Indigenous people in the Amazon forest in Brazil and in the Cross River State of Nigeria have used their inherited knowledge of nature to create reforestation programmes.Amanda Kayabi,18, lives in Samauma village in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. She belongs to the Kayabi indigenous tribe, one of several ethnic groups that live in the Xingu Indigenous Territory that was created in 1961 to protect the tribes from advancing settlers.Amanda Kayabi, 18, is a leader of seed collectors in Samauma village in the Xingu Indigenous Territory, Mato Grosso, Brazil (Photo: Camila Grinsztejn/Caio Correa/ISA)Members of the Yarang Women’s Movement in the Xingu Indigenous Territory comb the dense forest surrounding their villages for native seeds (Photo: Otavio Almeida/ISA)Deforestation and degradation of land now threaten their territory.“This worries me a lot, losing our forest,” said Ms Kayabi. “And water, too, that sustains all of us. We eat fish that comes from the Xingu river, we wash clothes in the river. Those who deforest contribute to the drying up of the water.”Despite assurances by the Brazilian government to curb illegal logging, deforestation in the Amazon soared by 22 per cent in 12 months to the highest level since 2006, according to an October 2021 report by the country’s Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (National Institute for Space Research).In order to restore large swathes of the lost forest, demand has grown for native tree seeds to recover ecosystems. Through this demand an initiative was born, where a group of indigenous groups located in the Xingu basin, which stretches across the Amazon forest and the neighbouring Cerrado savanna, collect and distribute tree seeds under what is called the Xingu Seed Network.Ms Kayabi, who is a leader of seed collectors in her village, said: “After I joined the network, I realised that all this work we do, restoring the forests, restoring the sources of the Xingu Indigenous Territory, is for our future, the future of our children, and I want this feeling to be strengthened in everyone that is planting the seeds that we have collected.”Deforested land for cattle near Xinguara, Para state, Brazil (Photo: Jonne Roriz/Bloomberg via Getty)There are more than 560 seed collectors, mostly women, who have gathered 250 tonnes of seeds and restored more than 6,600 hectares (16,300 acres) of degraded land since 2008.Eduardo Malta Campos-Filho, a forest expert with Brazil’s NGO Instituto Socioambiental (Socio-environmental Institute), which initiated the network, told i that indigenous groups held vast knowledge of the variety of food and plants that their ancestors once thrived on.The indigenous groups know how to plant seeds directly in the ground to rebuild forests quickly and help young trees survive drought, bypassing the need to grow saplings in nurseries.The community use the “muvuca” technique, in which seeds from more than 200 native forest species are mixed and spread over burnt, mismanaged or deforested land.A woman of the Ikpeng indigenous community in Mato Grosso, Brazil collecting native seeds for reforestation in the Xingu River basin, as part of the Xingu Seed Network (Photo: Carol Quintanilha/ISA)Families from Brasil Novo in the state of Para in northern Brazil make muvuca and plant 250kg of seeds for reforestation (Photo: Ana de Francesco/ISA)“I never believed that would be possible,” Mr Campos-Filho said. “Traditional knowledge can get us to change paradigms of how we see problems and solutions.”In Nigeria, one of the last remaining rainforests in the Cross River State south of the country is being saved by the Ekuri indigenous community.The Ekuri forest is about 33,600 hectares (83,000 acres) in size and is the largest communally-controlled forest in Nigeria. It is adjacent to the government-managed Cross River National Park which accounts for 40 per cent of Nigeria’s total rainforest, according to charity WWF.For centuries the Ekuri people have yielded the benefits of the forest – it provided them with food, drinking water and medicine. The 6,000-strong community are largely farmers while others make a living through small-scale hunting and fishing.Edwin Ogar, chief of the Ekuri community, told i that the communally controlled forest has played a fundamental role in changing attitudes to illegal logging. Mr Ogar was among several Ekuri leaders who were arrested and imprisoned for several days in the mid 1990s after they obstructed a road in protest against logging.The Ekuri forest in the Cross River State in southern Nigeria is one of the last remaining rainforests in the west African country (Photo: Edwin Ogar)While battles with illegal logging continues, efforts are also focused on restoring areas affected by climate change using centuries-old indigenous knowledge.“We know the fruits that can be adapted to climate change,” he said. “We organise meetings and look at areas impacted by climate change and we make sure it’s regenerated.“Some areas that have lost a lot species have started recovering which makes us very happy.”In the early 1980s, the villages of Old Ekuri and New Ekuri – located 7km apart – united in response to the proposed logging of their forest. Since then, harvesting timber for commercial purposes was banned while sustainable logging to build local housing and furniture was supported.It’s a far cry from the realities seen elsewhere in the country, which has lost more than 47 per cent of forest cover between 1990 and 2010, according to the US-based conservation website Mongabay.“Climate change has withered some of the biodiversity and has affected our water sources, some of these streams have dried up,” said Mr Ogar.“We feel that continuous work on this issue will surely bring back lost forest and we will continue to benefit from it like before.”Dr Tero Mustonen, co-founder of the Snowchange Cooperative, an NGO in Finland that works with indigenous communities across the Arctic, described climate change as the “legacy of colonialism”.“Those now suffering the most are in a way receiving the legacy and misuse of natural resources for over hundreds of years through the colonial process,” Dr Mustonen told i .“These things are not happening in a vacuum on the planet, there’s a lot of history of why climate change is happening.”He described how exploitation and conversion of land for economic profit in the past century has led to a “runway climate”.Nature is better preserved in areas controlled by indigenous communities, but despite this Western science largely overlooks such successes, Dr Mustonen said.He argued that in order to save the earth from the effects of climate change, science and research should embrace indigenous knowledge.“These areas have the space and potential to restart biodiversity hotspots or renew carbon sinks when that option has been lost in many other places because of population and heavy land uses,” he said.“They (indigenous people) are doing something new and fast that is meaningful.”"
How to Honor Indigenous Communities When You Travel,"Today, there are 546 federally recognized tribes. Here’s how to engage respectfully and thoughtfully with Indigenous cultures domestically.share this articleHistory is filled with stories of Indigenous tribes in what we now call the United States. While we are continually gaining more context around those stories, the conversations about Native Americans are typically in the past tense. But Sherry L. Rupert (Paiute/Washoe), CEO of the American Indian Alaska Native Tourism Association (AIANTA), says that despite misconceptions, Native culture isn’t a historic culture or a thing of the past. “Native Nations and communities are active, vibrant, rich places to visit with their own language, their own artisans, and their own songs, dance, and food,” says Rupert. According to Reclaiming Native Truth, a nonprofit project dedicated to empowering Native Americans and dispelling harmful misconceptions, 78 percent of Americans reported wanting to learn more about Native peoples, their histories, cultures, and contemporary stories. And there’s a lot more to learn. Today, there are 546 federally recognized tribes and countless more that are not. Here’s how to engage respectfully and thoughtfully with Indigenous cultures domestically.

Begin where you are The resource map Native Land is a good starting point to see what Indigenous lands you live on. There are cultural centers and websites, such as NativeAmerica.travel, the AIANTA’s travel experience website, which features Native-owned and tribally owned businesses and experiences. “Once you learn about Indigenous histories and think about Indigenous futures in places, it really starts to change the way that you see them,” says Jolie Varela (Nüümü Hupi/Yokuts), founder of Indigenous Women Hike, an initiative to reconnect the land and its original people. “And once they [travelers] learn that history, I think it opens a whole door for them. And then it just leads to being more mindful.” Research the history of your destination Thanks to online media, it’s easier than ever to find information about anything. Googling goes a long way, but with all the research we do when traveling outside of the United States, we often forget to think about cultural differences when traveling within the states. There are important differences and historical context from region to region, and that is especially true in terms of Indigenous tribes.ADVERTISEMENT“People don’t often do their research when they go to places, so they don’t know who the first people of those lands are,” says Varela. “Research ‘I’m going to be on Nüümü and Shoshone lands, these are the places that I can go to learn more about the land, and I can stop and get my gas here, and I can go and have lunch here. Or I can hire a Native guide, to take me around the land and to learn.’” Reading up on the Indigenous communities that live on the land will set you up for a more educated travel experience, and it can open up activities you may not have known were available. A few books that Varela recommends to gain a base understanding of the Indigenous experience are As Long As Grass Grows by Dina Gilio-Whitaker, Dispossessing the Wilderness by Mark David Spence, and Tending the Wild by M. Kat Anderson. They also suggest following social media accounts, such as @NavajoDarling, @Native_Power_Rangers, and @IndigenousWomenHike. Courtesy of Nez Perce Tourism Nez Perce Appaloosa horse riding session is a tour that includes a history of horse culture, riding at any experience level, and a presentation at Nez Perce National Historical Park. Support Native-owned tours There are many opportunities to learn about Indigenous cultures in any city as long as you know where to look. If you’re interested in a guided tour during your travels, look for a Native guide. Rupert compares the experience to a poetry reading, as you listen to a book read by an author versus someone else. “Whether you visit a national park, an urban setting, a beach, or anywhere in between, that land once belonged to an Indigenous community,” Rupert says. “Learning more about Native Nations and communities from someone with family ties that date back generations provides you with a new travel lens while giving you a deeper understanding of the American experience.” Travelers can use databases such as NativeAmerica.Travel to find Indigenous-run tourism activities and experiences. You can also see if there are any Indigenous cultural centers at your destination. These centers have resources and experts who can share information specific to your vacation destination.

Ecuador gives Indigenous people - and nature - a big win,"The recent decision by Ecuador’s highest court in favour of Indigenous people’s rights was a huge victory, not just for them but for nature too.The ruling by the country’s Constitutional Court, in favour of Indigenous people’s rights and their authority to decide on extractive projects that affect their land, upheld a landmark lower court ruling in 2018.The ruling was one of three handed down in January in favour of Indigenous communities. One (No. 273-19-JP) protects the A’i Cofán community from any extractive project on their land. Another (No. 28-19-IN) says that Indigeneous peoples’ consent will now be required for oil and mining projects throughout the Ecuadorian Amazon.The third (No. 45-15-IN) declares the water law, in force since 2014, unconstitutional because it fails to guarantee the resource as a public and communal good. Indigenous groups have long expressed concern that the law could allow for state intrusion into their rights to water and land use. The court also affirmed that reparations ordered by lower courts must be paid, by private companies and the government.The rulings are a massive victory for Ecuador’s Indigenous people, who make up 70% of the population of the Ecuadorian Amazon.The verdicts are also an undoubted blow to Ecuador’s recently arrived president, Guillermo Lasso. Last July, within months of being sworn into office, he issued a new hydrocarbons policy that promised to double oil production in Ecuador. Lasso did so in open defiance of Indigenous peoples’ concern for millions of acres of pristine rainforest as well as the physical and cultural survival of Indigenous nations."
"Indigenous Aussie suicide, incarceration rates continue to rise: report","CANBERRA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Rates of incarceration and suicide among Indigenous Australians have increased for the second straight year after a landmark government agreement to address disadvantage.The Productivity Commission, the Australian federal government review agency, on Thursday published updated data on the Closing the Gap program.Established in 2008, the Closing the Gap framework aims to reduce the disadvantage faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.In 2020, federal state and territory governments reached an agreement with Indigenous groups on 17 new Closing the Gap targets across education, employment, justice, safety, housing, land and waters and health and wellbeing.According to Thursday's data, the suicide rate for Indigenous Australians has increased from 25 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 27.1 in 2019 and 27.9 in 2020.By comparison, the suicide rate for the entire Australian population in 2020 was 12.1 per 100,000.By June 2021 the Indigenous incarceration rate was 2,222.7 prisoners per 100,000 people, up from 2,142.9 two years ago.The figure is 10 times higher than that for the general population.Productivity Commission data revealed the life expectancy for Indigenous people born in 2015-17 was 71.6 years for males and 75.6 years for females compared to 80.2 and 83.4 years respectively for non-Indigenous people.It marks a significant improvement compared to those born between 2005-07 but the report predicted that by the end of the 21st century, Indigenous people would still be dying younger than non-Indigenous Australians.It means the Closing the Gap program is not on track to reach its target of equal life expectancy by 2031, according to a report from the Australian Associated Press. ■"
Indigenous leaders call for Thunder Bay Police Service be dismantled and re-examined,"Send this page to someone via emailTHUNDER BAY, Ont. — Indigenous leaders demanded the dismantling of the Thunder Bay Police Service on Wednesday and said it should immediately be barred from carrying out major crime investigations due to what they called “repeated failures.”Earlier this month, a group of independent investigators shared a report with the Office of the Independent Police Review Director recommending the reinvestigation of 14 sudden deaths in the city dating back to between 2006 and 2019.Speaking at the Ontario legislature, Anishinabek Nation Grand Council Chief Reg Niganobe said in light of that report, it is now “painfully clear” that Indigenous people have no trust in the police force and the Thunder Bay Police Services Board.“The Thunder Bay Police Service leaves a trail of inadequate investigations and negligently managed record system and a lack of substantive oversight,” Niganobe said.“Trust is broken and every day Thunder Bay Police Service remains in control of major crime investigations is another day Indigenous people are at risk in the city.”Story continues below advertisementNiganobe and Nishnawbe Aski Nation Deputy Grand Chief Anna Betty Achneepineskum said they’re currently reviewing their options _ which include the Ontario Provincial Police _ of who can serve and protect the city if the police force is dismantled.“No more families should have to endure this racism and continued victimization at the hands of the police,” Achneepineskum said.Nine sudden-death reinvestigations were recommended in a 2018 review by the Broken Trust committee, which was formed that year after the Office of the Independent Police Review Director found evidence of systemic racism at the Thunder Bay Police Service and that it was affecting the investigations into the deaths of Indigenous people.At the time, the watchdog said the “inadequacy” of the police force’s sudden-death investigations was “so problematic” that at least nine cases needed to be reinvestigated.Achneepineskum said two of the nine reopened cases involved her family members and she alleged the force’s reinvestigations of those cases were “flawed.”A spokesman for the Thunder Bay Police Service said Chief Sylvie Hauth will be reviewing the comments made by the Indigenous leaders on Wednesday and discuss them further with the Thunder Bay Police Services Board “in the very near future.”Story continues below advertisementIn a statement, the chair of that board said its work to transform the police force and address the “deep systemic issues” is ongoing.“I, as Board Chair, understand more work needs to be done to rebuild our relationships with Northwestern Ontario Indigenous leaders and people,” Kristen Oliver said.“Without trust in law enforcement from our community, the system doesn’t work.”Niganobe and Achneepineskum urged the provincial government on Wednesday to work with Indigenous communities to ensure that effective police services are delivered in the city and said the government needs to prioritize listening to the Indigenous people who live in, work in and visit Thunder Bay.A spokeswoman for Ontario Solicitor General Sylvia Jones said the provincial government is “deeply concerned about the situation in Thunder Bay.”Hannah Jensen noted that the Ontario Civilian Police Commission has the power through the Police Services Act to appoint an administrator or disband a police service if certain conditions are met. Municipalities can also dissolve police services under the act.“Should the municipality choose to take that direction and choose another police service, the province will respect their local decision,” she added.Story continues below advertisementAt the legislature, Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner and Liberal house leader John Fraser called on the provincial government to launch an inquiry into the Thunder Bay Police Service.“The government should be fully engaged with First Nations. They should be fully engaged with the people of Thunder Bay. And the government’s not there,” Fraser said.“You have to take some measures. If you have a challenge where there are 14 uninvestigated deaths, why is that?”During question period, Kiiwetinoong MPP Sol Mamakwa, the NDP’s critic for Indigenous and treaty relations, asked Jones what action the province has taken since it heard about the coroner’s office’s recommendation to reinvestigate the 14 deaths.Mamakwa also asked if the government would have the Ontario Provincial Police immediately assume oversight of the Thunder Bay police force.In response, Jones said she wrote to the Ontario Civilian Police Commission to investigate what she called “very serious allegations” in January. The commission launched an investigation on Feb. 10 into the police force at the request of the solicitor general and the Thunder Bay Police Services Board.Jones added that the OPP are also conducting an independent investigation.“Those investigations are ongoing and we will allow that to happen without political interference,” she said, noting they will “bring back trust and faith” in the police services in Thunder Bay and elsewhere.Story continues below advertisementOliver said the Thunder Bay Police Services Board would be convening for an emergency meeting on Saturday to discuss the concerns brought forward by Niganobe, Achneepineskum and Mamakwa.As of January, 28 of the 44 recommendations made for the Thunder Bay Police Service in the Broken Trust review were considered complete, with an additional 12 listed as ongoing."
"New 'Indigenous Voices' podcast connects Northwest's people, land, and history","A new podcast from Fort Nisqually Living History Museum is all about Northwest stories told by Indigenous voices. Like so many thing silver linings of the past few years, it came about partly because of pandemic-inspired online programming created by museum staffer Elizabeth Rudrud.“We were really looking to find ways to continue to engage our audiences, to make sure we’re providing value for our community,” Rudrud told KIRO Newsradio. “And it really was an opportunity to just stop and re-evaluate [and] pivot.”“Fort Nisqually, being established here in 1833 in the South Sound, Native American communities were integral to all operations, working and living and purchasing and trading, and just thriving in the Puget Sound when Hudson’s Bay Company came here, so it’s a very important part of the story,” Rudrud said.“I reached out to Charlotte Basch at Puyallup Tribe and had a conversation with her on where can we begin on making sure the story is incorporated in a meaningful way into the museum’s interpretation [and] museum operations,” Rudrud continued. “And she and I identified that to do so really needs intentional effort … it needs to be something that’s not an afterthought.”“If there was an opportunity to really focus in and create this platform for tribal voices to tell the history of the Puget Sound that would be the way to go. And she connected us all of us together.”The new monthly podcast is called “Indigenous Voices” and it debuted in February via most podcast platforms. The event that inspired it – a result of the conversation between Elizabeth Rudrud and Charlotte Basch – was produced a year ago. Panelists included members of the Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Steilacoom and Squaxin Island Tribes.That March 2021 online panel discussion was moderated by well-known author and historian Jennifer Ott. Topic for the discussion was what’s called the “1855-1856 Treaty War” – which included death and destruction in Seattle and the White River Valley, and which was precipitated by a U.S. government document: the Treaty of Medicine Creek from December 26, 1854.KIRO Newsradio has presented elements of this history before – such as the actions and missteps of Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens to enforce multiple treaties and remove Indigenous people to reservations to make way for settlers, and the criminal prosecution and execution of Indigenous people, including Leschi, who were clearly Treaty War combatants and not criminals. Those earlier radio and web stories have often included the voices of Indigenous people; failure to do so would be inexcusable, and the depth, breadth and accuracy of the stories would suffer.However, the panel at Point Defiance last March and the new podcast are qualitatively different and better by several orders of magnitude: both feature tribal people talking at length about that brutal time in Northwest history and how it has been understood within multiple tribal communities.The 1850s were a formative era for the place in which we all now live, and decisions made and official policies first enforced then affect each of us every day. And, though it also really wasn’t that long ago, it is an era which is still often mischaracterized and misunderstood, if not completely overlooked.“There have been a number of narratives,” Warren KingGeorge of the Muckleshoot Tribe told KIRO Newsradio earlier this month. KingGeorge took part in the panel last year and was the first member of the group to suggest creating a podcast.“There have been a number of explanations and number of versions of this story of the Medicine Creek Treaty being told,” KingGeorge continued. “But in my opinion, I think this would have been the first time that a consortium of representatives and descendants from the Medicine Creek Treaty came together and had a conversation that involved the history of our people and of this state of Washington.”Danny Marshall, chair of the Steilacoom Tribe, is also a panelist and podcast participant. He says the 168-year-old treaty is a “forever document” which is still in effect, and which still has a profound impact on this area’s people and culture.“You can go online and pull up a copy of the Medicine Creek Treaty, signed in 1854, and see what it says in it,” Marshall said. “That’s eye-opening for many people, just listing the tribes that are on there, [and] many can’t be located today.”“And then also the promises that were made within the treaty, and realizing that many of those promises were never kept,” Marshall continued. “So, why is it important? Because it’s a forever document. It’s not one of those things that was signed between the tribal people and the government to be just a mode of operation for the day, but it was to guide us into the future.”“There have been many different ways the government has guided this into the future and kind of taken new directions. With always one potential goal which was assimilation and enculturation of the Indian people into the communities that they were planning to develop.”“It really didn’t go as planned,” Marshall continued. “The whole genesis of the history of Washington state has been things didn’t go as the president initially intended. Franklin Pierce sent [Isaac] Stevens out here to negotiate these treaties with one purpose in mind: set up one reservation for all the Indian people to be contained, and then develop opportunities for American [non-Native] communities to be settled here in the area.”The people and voices taking part in the Fort Nisqually project effectively take what can seem to some like a distant and abstract history and make it concrete, real, and, especially, human scaled. Listening to the podcast, what once may have been a few pages in a state-approved curriculum from the 1970s becomes an inspiring story about a community of multiple generations defending their homeland. In this regard, the 1850s in the lower reaches of what the Europeans first called Puget Sound or the White River Valley have emotional parallels to what’s taking place in Ukraine in 2022.And because the subject is war and the social and political conditions that led to deadly encounters, these are not exactly lightweight discussions.Warren KingGeorge says the conversations for the panels and the podcast episodes have sometimes created moments that were difficult, uncomfortable, and even powerful.“We can try to imagine what some of the emotions that we’re going through our ancestors’ minds at that time and in their hearts, the perspective of someone who’s willing to lay down their life and fight for what they believe in to their death,” KingGeorge said. “That we don’t want to move our people here. We don’t want to give up these resources there. We want to retain our homeland, the place that we feel most comfortable.”“We’re willing to fight for it to our last breath,” KingGeorge continued. “And sometimes that can get a little emotional, when you’re trying to explain to somebody why it is Native Americans feel the way they do about their homelands [and] about their traditional territory.”On a personal note, as a journalist and historian, one thing I often feel when I talk to an Indigenous person with deep roots here is that, in spite of my best intentions, I remain ignorant about Indigenous culture and history. Though I have read much of the material about this history (most of it written by white people, of course) and have traveled extensively around the region and paid close attention to the stories, I’m always afraid I’m going to say something clumsy or unintentionally offensive.Danny Marshall says those feelings are not uncommon. But, he says the Fort Nisqually panel discussions and the new podcast might help address this phenomenon by giving people an opportunity to become more knowledgeable.“[This projects] makes the public more comfortable with what they don’t know and gives them an opportunity to try and reach out and get more information,” Marshall said. “[Or] at least feel comfortable asking the questions when they come to our museum, so they’re not saying, ‘I’m the dumb person really doesn’t know anything. I’m afraid to ask something so I don’t want to offend anybody’ but [instead], ‘Here’s my question.’”“And then we have these great conversations,” Marshall said, pointing to noticeable changes he’s seen in Steilacoom in just the past year. “We’ve experienced that already – people will come in and say ‘Yeah, we saw the YouTube video that was podcast on the treaty panel, and we wanted to come in and visit and talk more about it.’”And what about something as simple – and complex – as what words are used to name or describe Northwest residents with roots going back thousands of years? It’s easy for anyone to stumble and get confused by the differences – or appropriateness – of knowing when to “Indian,” “American Indian,” “Native,” “Native American” or “Indigenous.”Marshall suggests a simple approach.“If you really want to get personal on this, we just identify ourselves as people,” Marshall said. “And sometimes I’ll identify us as ‘people,’ and the other people as ‘the new people.’”“It’s easy, because everybody is people,” he continued. “And they’re people here in the area. And you love it because you’ve spent your life here … [and] we’ve got stories that have been passed down generation after generation within our communities that that tie us even stronger to the land. But there’s space for [both].”With projects like the “Indigenous Voices” podcast and the other programs at Fort Nisqually, one can’t help but feel a sense of hope for even more understanding.Marshall agrees, and says it’s clear that all of us who live here now truly love the land, regardless of how long our families have been here. And while Indigenous people have a longer and deeper connection, this shared love of the land can be the foundation, Marshall believes, of a lot of understanding and progress.“This is a beautiful place with so much that makes us connected to the area that we can all love and share,” Marshall said. “We haven’t shared well over time, but we can.”In addition the podcast and panel discussions, Elizabeth Rudrud says they are also working on creating an accompanying curriculum which will ultimately be made available to educators around the region.You can hear Feliks every Wednesday and Friday morning on Seattle’s Morning News, read more from him here, and subscribe to The Resident Historian Podcast here.

Autism spectrum disorders underdiagnosed in Indigenous people,"Six Nations is one of many Indigenous communities across Canada where autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are underdiagnosed.Jacqueline Smith, Program Supervisor at Six Nations Child and Youth, says diagnostic rates are lower here even though statistics are scarce on the reserve.“We do not have specific stats but we do know that there is an underrepresentation in this community compared to children identified/diagnoses in surrounding areas,” said Smith. “This is one of the main reasons why we are expanding our programs on Six Nations to ensure we are able to support children with ASD and their families.”This Saturday, April 2, marks annual World Autism Awareness Day.There is no dedicated autism support program at Six Nations Health Services – yet.The team at Six Nations Health is working with Autism Ontario to increase programming on the reserve to help people with ASD.Autism Spectrum Disorder refers to a range of symptoms that can affect a person emotionally, intellectually, socially and behaviourally. People with ASD can have interpersonal difficulties, trouble recognizing social cues others take for granted, rigid behaviour patterns and obsessions with routine or certain subjects, dislike socializing, refuse to make eye contact, and engage in “stimming” behaviours (self-stimulation) such as hand-flapping, rocking back and forth and humming, among a host of other symptoms. They can also be overwhelmed by too much sensory input, via sight, sound, taste, touch, etc.Some people with ASD are completely non-verbal (unable to speak), while others on the spectrum can have advanced language skills and a higher-than-average intellect. That’s why it’s a spectrum, as autism-type symptoms can manifest so broadly among different people.Some famous people who have ASD include Jerry Seinfeld, Carl Sagan, Sir Isaac Newton, and Mozart, to name a few.Some require intensive, daily support in the home and school, while others live independently.Smith said Six Nations is soon going to be rolling out new autism services to complement the existing services for youth with ASD on the reserve.“We are looking to expand programs connected to the Ontario Autism Program,” she said, with more updates on what those programs will look like to come.Currently, there are no diagnostic services for young people with ASD on Six Nations. Those suspected to be on the spectrum are referred off-reserve for a diagnosis, and that’s something the health team at Six Nations Child and Youth can help families with, said Smith.“Besides that, we do offer services through Six Nations of the Grand River that support children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, for example, case management, speech, occupational therapy, etc.,” she said. “We would connect families with resources within the community and surrounding communities. If there is an unmet need, we can connect with Jordan’s Principle, as well.”To connect with supports through the Child and Youth Health Team please email oapinformation@sixnations.ca or call 519-445-4983."
Budget ignores Indigenous people: Greens,"Greens Senator Dorinda Cox has taken a swipe at the federal budget as a ""last-ditch play for votes""."
Climate crisis: Indigenous groups both victims and saviours,"Indigenous communities are increasingly being recognised as important voices in the global response to climate changeParis (AFP) – Long portrayed as victims of climate change, indigenous peoples who have struggled for years to protect ancestral lands and ways of life from destruction are finally being recognised as playing an important role in defending precious environments.Advertising Read more""In the face of climatic, economic and health catastrophes, reality forces the recognition of indigenous peoples' knowledge, and a new relationship of respect,"" said Gregorio Mirabal, head of the COICA indigenous organisation.""Now we are not victims, we are the solution!""That message was reinforced in a sweeping report by UN climate experts on the impacts and adaptation to global warming, released on Monday, that outlined in harrowing detail the challenges facing humanity and the planet they depend upon for survival.It highlights that many indigenous peoples are on the frontlines of global warming, such as those in the Arctic whose communities and traditions are threatened by melting sea ice and rising waters.But it also underscores what these communities and their intimate knowledge of nature -- transmitted from generation to generation -- can bring to the fight against climate change, in particular to limiting its impacts.That is crucial since indigenous communities, who number less than half a billion people worldwide, steward land home to 80 percent of Earth's remaining biodiversity, notes the IPCC.From the Amazon to Siberia, these communities have been forced to develop methods of coping with external challenges ""for centuries and have developed strategies for resilience in changing environments that can enrich and strengthen other adaptation efforts"", it said.A major cause of their vulnerability acknowledged for the first time by the IPCC in this report is colonialism.""I think it's a huge advancement,"" said Sherilee Harper, of the University of Alberta, Canada, adding that this is a crucial context that helps not only understand the problems facing indigenous groups, but also to frame solutions.Harper was among the authors of the IPCC report, which also included indigenous contributors and peer reviewers for the first time.Previously, she told AFP, ""there was a tendency to paint them as victims of climate change"" without the agency to act.""Of course, that is not true.""- 'Arrogance' -Indigenous groups have welcomed the IPCC's recognition of ancestral knowledge, but say the situation requires more than words.""We need to come up with some kind of action-oriented strategy,"" said Rodion Sulyandziga, of the International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Climate Change.""We need to combine all our efforts.

Aboriginal custodianship key to sustainable wild sandalwood management,"Wealth Generation is a fundamental objective of colonisation, and is primarily generated through the extraction and exploitation of resources away from First Nations people’s and concentrated into the hands of settlers and their corporations.The extraction of resources in Australia is not limited to what can be blasted and dug out of the ground, it can include what grows on top of the traditional lands of Aboriginal people.Since 1845, West Australian native sandalwood has been a significant resource for colonial governments and corporations— today, It now represents an important opportunity for financial independence for the First Nations people.Sandalwood has very high economic value, the oils in the wood are in high demand and lots can be priced at $US15,000 to $US17,000 per tonne.The Aboriginal-owned and run sandalwood industry is gaining momentum with investment from native title communities and enterprises, and WA Government support.There are calls, however, for the industry to shift to plantation grown sandalwood only and to phase-out of wild sandalwood harvesting altogether in WA.This could severely impact this promising economic development avenue for First Nations communities on sandalwood country.Colonial settler business and government interests for more than a century have severely depleted sandalwood populations, while in parallel these stakeholders are also investing in plantation sandalwood for further profit.In contrast, First Nations people are being deprived of the opportunity to derive sustainable income from their lands.Should these recommendations be followed, this would be in direct contravention of United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People —of which Australia is a signatory.These recommendations do not consider the sustainable sandalwood harvesting practices of traditional custodians of this highly valuable and ecologically significant resource.Traditionally, wild sandalwood was harvested by Aboriginal custodians within spiritually defined relationships and linkages defined by the Dreaming and as an ecologically significant species offering cultural, food and medicinal properties.Today, wild sandalwood is also harvested for commercial purposes—such as the production of fragrant oils for use in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and timber used in incense.“First Nations people are being deprived of the opportunity to derive sustainable income from their lands”The sustainable harvesting and seeding practices of wild sandalwood by First Nations enterprises are recognised and respected internationally and locally. First Nations relationship with sandalwood species is not simply about business, it is also a spiritual and cultural responsibility.Recognising the sustainable practices of Aboriginal custodianship, the WA Sandalwood Taskforce recommended in 2020 that the annual quota of wild sandalwood harvest for Aboriginal groups be increased from 10 to 20 per cent of the annual wild sandalwood harvest.Indeed, greater access to harvest already dead sandalwood trees on traditional lands is the ultimate sustainability story and an important value consideration for the end users of sandalwood products—such as emerging ecologically aware markets and consumers.It has recently been estimated that the population of Australian sandalwood trees has declined by up to 90 per cent since the advent of commercial harvesting.What is certain is that the wild sandalwood population is dwindling as a direct result of non-Aboriginal commercial harvesting.In addition, colonial forms of agriculture have resulted in the unintended consequences for the ecosystems that sandalwood trees exist within.Non-Aboriginal harvesting and illegal poaching has led to major vulnerability of wild sandalwood resulting in calls to restrict the harvesting of sandalwood to plantation-grown only, thus halting all wild harvest and effectively reducing the allocation afforded to Aboriginal communities to zero. It was also recently declared an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.While on the surface this may seem to be an apt response to this ecological crisis, we argue this response reflects age-old colonial settler inherent biases and tactics of unsustainable wealth extraction of natural resources, without reference to or respect for the sustainable harvesting and seeding methods practiced by First Nations Aboriginal communities—who are the custodians of these wild-growth sandalwood trees.First Nations communities within the WA regions on whose lands wild sandalwood has grown, prospered, and been sustainably harvested for millennia, are also amongst the most economically impoverished in Australia.In the shifting of all sandalwood harvesting from wild to plantation grown populations, largely non-Aboriginal interests are to benefit from the extraction of this resource, while for Aboriginal enterprises and communities this avenue for sustainable socio-economic benefit is being removed altogether.Under Aboriginal custodianship, sandalwood thrived for thousands of years prior to European colonisation and exploitation of the tree population by non-Aboriginal interests.Traditional Owners and native title holders argue that custodianship, development and management of wild sandalwood trees must be ceded to First Nations people for whom these trees are growing wild on their traditional lands."
"Agri. Minister asks FAO to make financing ‘equally available’ for indigenous people, small farmers","Cognisant of the devastating effects of climate change on Small Island Developing States (SIDs), Guyana’s Minister of Agriculture Zulfikar Mustapha has underscored the need for financing to be equally available for indigenous people and small farmers across the Caribbean region.The minister’s call was made during the 37th Session of the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO’s) Regional Conference for Latin America and the Caribbean in Quito, Ecuador where new strategies to combat climate change were shared.“We would like to see a reference of a financial mechanism that makes resources readily and equally available for smart, small adaptive, and unformed research targeting small farming communities and indigenous people,” Mustapha urged.With the effects of climate change already seen and experienced, the Agriculture Minister noted that the world has arrived at the point where “strong decisions” need to be made on what is necessary to move forward.His remarks were also supported by the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, Rural Transformation, Industry and Labour of St. Vincent and the Grenadines Saboto Caesar who urged that even more time, money and effort are critical to developing an apt climate strategy for SIDs.On that point, Mustapha supported Caesar’s call for a marine resources survey to be conducted for SIDs in the region.It involves the inspection, survey or examination of marine vessels to assess, monitor and report on their condition and the products on them, as well as inspection of the damage caused to both vessels and cargo.According to Mustapha, this can be crucial to alleviating poverty.“Such a survey is very important for us in the region because the blue and green economy in these parts of the world contributes significantly to poverty reduction so that is something we should consider,” the minister added.Guyana like other nations across the Caribbean has been working to improve its agricultural capacity and food security through initiatives like the shade house project for high-value crops and the corn and soya bean Ebini project.But Minister Mustapha noted that with the problems brought on by climate change, only SIDs are “taking the major risks.”In this regard, he called on the FAO to adopt stronger measures that will help to alleviate the impacts of the global issue.“We cannot allow one or two countries to dictate the pace of our way forward; we are living in these times, and we are living in these vulnerable places and we know what we are experiencing, and we are now appealing that the FAO to take a stand,” he added."
Brazil's Indigenous Gaming Scene Is On the Rise,"It’s a steamy night in the jungle. A huge one-legged creature with a detached jaw roars in the face of the protagonist, a young Indigenous woman. She grips her double-edged spear in both hands, readying herself for a fight.This is a scene from Araní, a Brazilian game currently in development. The game is named after its lead character, an Indigenous warrior of the Sun Tribe intent on saving her people from a mysterious, mythological power. It was announced in 2018 by Diorama Digital, a studio based in Pernambuco, a state in Northeastern Brazil.Brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world and is home to many different cultures. There are those hailing from the favelas seen in movies like 2002's City of God, and the Carnival parties and tropical bossa nova which are familiar to tourists, but it is the country’s many Indigenous peoples and traditional communities that caught the attention of the team at Diorama.The country is also home to 850,000 Native peoples, living in 300 communities. They make up 1.1 percent of the country's 213.3 million inhabitants, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.During the game’s planning, game developer Everaldo Neto says Araní’s willpower made her the obvious choice for the protagonist. “Everything happened in a very organic manner—it was almost like she picked us, and not the other way around,” he says. “We knew we needed a strong woman who was small considering the scale of her challenges, but huge in her deeds.”The gaming scene in Brazil’s Indigenous communities is surging too. For example, during 2020, in the middle of the pandemic, a Free Fire tournament named the Indigenous Villages Cup saw 288 “guilds,” each made up of Indigenous gamers, participate. Among the ethnicities were Guaraní, Karajá, Xakriabá, Kalapalo, Kaigang, Kaiowá, Amondawa, and Xokleng peoples, just to name a few.WIRED spoke to three female Indigenous gamers to learn more about their experiences in Brazil's gaming communities, and all three explained that some players considered their presence unusual, while others even doubted their Indigenous origins or heritage.Walela Soeikigh “Kin” Suruí, a 21-year-old medical student, come from the Suruí Pater people in Rondônia state. She says, “There is a lot of prejudice to this day, and it becomes heavier when it has to do with electronics, as many people think that by being Indigenous, we can’t have mobiles, computers, or even gaming consoles. Hence, it is important to show that we can be where we want and do whatever we want without losing our culture and link to nature.”Araní “is very relevant in order to feel represented, as few games have us as reference for characters,” says Yotolé Terena, a 23-year-old Twitch streamer and undergrad student, who is a member of the Terena people of the state of Mato Grosso.Suruí applauded Araní as “incredible,” explaining that over the years she has found scant few games anchored in “real Indigenous cultures with a good story not portraying them as savages.”Decolonizing Gaming With Indigenous FacesIn gaming history, Indigenous people all over the Americas share a journey of abuse that’s not much different from real life. In 1982, the now defunct game studio Mystique released Custer’s Revenge for the Atari 2600, a game where the protagonist had to avoid obstacles while wearing a cavalry hat, bandana, gloves, and boots (and nothing else) while sporting a visible erection in order to rape a Native American woman strapped to a pole. The attempt to rerelease it years ago was, rightfully, met with outrage.In 1991, Konami introduced its classic side-scrolling run-and-gun shooter Sunset Riders for arcades, which had a stage with Native Americans as minions and “Chief Scalpem” as the boss. In the SNES version, only Scalpem was left, although his name was changed to “Chief Wigwam,” and his henchmen were substituted by the outlaws of other stages. The Wigwam name was favored over Scalpem in arcade version rereleases for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 consoles.Araní could be a fresh start: an attempt to bury those images in the past and build a more inclusive future, where everyone can see themselves in their favorite pastime. Mirim Gonçalves, “Luna,” a 22-year-old gamer and member of the Guarani people from Santa Catarina state in Brazil’s south. For her, gaming is an important part of self-discovery. She really got into it at the Free Fire Indigenous Villages Cup. Luna is also an Alphabetization and Arts teacher who sees gaming as an educational tool “to show our culture and struggles.”“Many folks don’t know the difference between mythology, religiosity, and folklore,” says Yotolé, who hopes that Araní lives up to its promise of promoting Indigenous cultures and teaching people more about them."
Revealing an Ice Age Route for Indigenous Peoples,"This article was originally published at Hakai Magazine and has been republished under Creative Commons.As early as 18,500 years ago, the first peoples in what is today known as the Americas spread south from Beringia, a now-sunken continent between Asia and North America. Inland travel was all but cut off by the massive Cordilleran Ice Sheet, which shrouded most of British Columbia, Yukon, and southeast Alaska in a thick layer of ice. But at its fringes, the ice sheet was melting, revealing a path of rugged islands and exposed coastline. People moved into this gap, slowly spreading down the coast in boats, following the “kelp highway,” and sojourning on islands along the way, such as Sanak and Kodiak in Alaska and Calvert in British Columbia. Now researchers including Chris Hebda, an archaeologist at the Hakai Institute*, have identified parts of northern Vancouver Island in British Columbia as ice-free, human-friendly lands.The evidence comes from Topknot Lake, located two kilometers inland on northwestern Vancouver Island, and Little Woss Lake, nestled among the mountains in the north-central part of the island.Drawing on satellite imagery, elevation data, an understanding of how the sea level has changed over the past several millennia, the chronology of how vegetation changed through time, and the glacial extent, Hebda and his colleagues pinpointed the two lakes as places likely to yield the oldest environmental records possible.“Lakes are a really good source of information about the past,” Hebda says. “You have sediments running off the hills, coming down and settling into the lake, so you get really even layers constantly being deposited over many thousands of years.”To reconstruct what the environment would have been like was not easy. The team hiked through swamp and thick bush, and then took two canoes out onto the water. Between the two canoes, they put a plank of plywood with a hole drilled in the center, into which they placed a tubed coring apparatus. One meter at a time, they pushed the tube down and collected sediment from the lakebed, eventually reaching the ancient clays and silts they were after.Usually when studying old lakebeds, you’ll hit a layer of impassable glacial till, Hebda says. But at Topknot Lake, that never happened. The team kept digging deeper into the sediment—and deeper into time—until their equipment reached its maximum extent. “We just couldn’t go any further with what we had,” Hebda says. Most lake cores will range anywhere from 2–7 meters long, Hebda says, but with Topknot, they recovered 11.25 meters of sediment. The fact that they ran out of equipment before they ran out of lake sediment to excavate made Hebda realize they had found something very old, and very exciting.Archaeologist Chris Hebda analyzed leaves, charcoal, and other remnants that had been trapped in lakebed sediments. The resulting ancient DNA data show that the environment around Topknot Lake would have been hospitable to human habitation 18,500 years ago. Shanna BakerTo analyze the sediments, the team washed them through screens and filtered out larger objects, such as pine needles, leaves, charcoal, and pieces of grass or trees, and calculated their ages using radiocarbon dating. Finding these items, Hebda says, can be very challenging. “I spent many hours looking under the microscope through all the sediments to find enough little pieces.”The scientists also looked for traces of pollen and algae, which offered evidence of the types of vegetation that thrived in the area thousands of years ago. They also took their samples to the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, where they used a new technique called sedimentary ancient DNA to get a more holistic picture of the ancient environment around the lakes. This method involves extracting small—and possibly broken—strands of plant, animal, and bacteria DNA from the sediments and then comparing them to a database of known DNA.“The work that the Hakai group is doing is very progressive,” says Loren Davis, an archaeologist at Oregon State University who was not involved in the study. “It’s exactly the kind of stuff that we need in order to understand what the world was like early on along the Pacific coast and what the potential parameters could be for understanding what the lives of people might’ve been like.”From their research, the team discovered the area surrounding Topknot Lake was ice-free at least 18,500 years ago, and since they never hit the glacial till layer, Hebda says it’s also possible that the lake was never covered by ice.Mikkel Winther Pedersen, a researcher at the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre who was part of the team, says it’s possible people may have ventured into the area before 18,500 years ago. “We know humans are in northernmost Siberia 30,000 years ago—we have direct archaeological evidence—so why should they wait 15,000 years before migrating across the Beringia Land Bridge into the Americas if they already walked from Africa to northern Siberia and adapted to those cold conditions?” What is missing, Pedersen says, is the evidence of that earlier arrival.But that’s the view from Western archaeology’s focus on material remains.The traditional stories of the Quatsino First Nation in northwestern Vancouver Island do tell of that earlier arrival. Quatsino hereditary Chief Sonny Wallas (David Hanuse) says his people were in the area before the last ice age and only survived it by going to Klaskino—an ancient village on the Brooks Peninsula about 50 kilometers southeast of Topknot Lake.People may have ventured into the area before 18,500 years ago.Wallas’ great-grandfather James Wallas—co-author of Kwakiutl Legends—told him the story of how the Quatsino were warned by their protector, the thunderbird, that the ice was coming. “The thunderbird, back then, didn’t have good eyes, and the snail did have good eyes, so the thunderbird asked the snail if they could switch eyes,” Sonny Wallas says. “The thunderbird said, ‘I feel something bad is coming, and I need to see.’”Wallas says he has heard two histories about the origins of the Quatsino people: that their earliest descendants crossed a land bridge and that their earliest descendants were created from the land in North America. Wallas doesn’t know which to believe, but he wonders if the Creation Story of the grizzly bear might offer insight. He says the grizzly bear started off in the north and made its way south, along the coast, and taught eight tribes each how to speak a different dialect. “That’s why the way you say grizzly bear is the same word from up north to down south.”For now, the physical evidence from Topknot Lake shows that the landscape 18,500 years ago would have been a treeless tundra—very similar to that on Beringia—with grasses, sedges, heathers, and sagebrush. The terrain was dotted with the cup-shaped blue and white flowers of Jacob’s ladder; dark-purple, mealy textured crowberries; and the spiky flowers of bistort. Many of these plants could have been used to make tools or as sources of food and medicine.The data found at Little Woss Lake indicated a slightly younger history. Deglaciated about 14,000 years ago, this mountainous environment would have hosted alder and pine trees, ferns, grizzly bears, and chinook salmon, indicating a well-developed ecosystem that was suited to human occupation and that many people could have made their home.Hebda says it’s important to dispel the notion that humans were racing to spread through the Americas and get down to the southernmost tip as fast as possible. “We’re talking about thousands of years and many, many lifetimes,” Hebda says. “The movements are more incremental … they’re just living their lives.”* The Hakai Institute and Hakai Magazine are both part of the Tula Foundation.

In contrast, 11% of people age 65 and older living in the United States have dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.“Something about the pre-industrial subsistence lifestyle appears to protect older Tsimane and Moseten from dementia,” said Margaret Gatz, the lead study author and professor of psychology, gerontology and preventive medicine at the Center for Economic and Social Research at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.Researchers used computed tomography (CT) brain scan images, cognitive and neurological assessments and culturally appropriate questionnaires — facilitated by a local team of trained translators and Bolivian physicians — to diagnose dementia and cognitive impairment among the Tsimane and Moseten.The study, published in Alzheimer’s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association, found only five cases of dementia among 435 Tsimane people and just one case among 169 Moseten age 60 and over.In the same over-60 groups, the research team diagnosed about 8% of Tsimane and 10% of Moseten with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is typically marked by early stage memory loss or decline of other cognitive ability, such as language or spatial perception. The study’s authors pointed out these rates are more comparable to MCI in high-income countries like the U.S.Researchers were surprised to find that the study participants found to have dementia or MCI frequently had unusual and prominent calcifications of their intracranial arteries. These study participants frequently displayed Parkinsonian symptoms during neurological examinations and cognitive deficits in attention, spatial awareness and executive functioning.Although calcifications were more common among the cognitively impaired, researchers also observed these vascular calcifications in the CT scans of those without dementia or MCI. They say more research is needed to understand the role of vascular factors as well as infectious and inflammatory disorders — which are highly prevalent in these populations — along with other risks for dementia. To this end, the research team is currently returning to all the Tsimane and Moseten villages to revisit those who were previously assessed.Comparing dementia rates among Tsimane, Moseten and other indigenous peoplesThe roughly 17,000 Tsimane remain physically very active throughout their lifespans as they fish, hunt and farm with hand tools and gather food from the forest. The 3,000 Moseten also reside in rural villages and engage in subsistence agricultural work. Unlike the more isolated Tsimane, they live closer to towns and have schools, access to clean water and medical services, and are more likely to be literate.The study authors compared their results to a systematic review of 15 studies of indigenous populations in Australia, North America, Guam and Brazil. That earlier review found dementia prevalence ranging from 0.5% to 20% among indigenous older adults.The fact that indigenous populations in other parts of the world have high rates of dementia may be due to a higher amount of contact with — and adoption of lifestyles of — their non-indigenous neighbors. They also face greater risks of diabetes, hypertension, alcohol abuse, obesity and cardiovascular disease.These dementia risk factors are extremely low among the Tsimane and Moseten populations. Prior research published in The Lancet showed the Tsimane people have extraordinarily healthy hearts in older age and the lowest prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis (a disease that shows in the form of fatty deposits inside arteries) of any population known to science. This distinction may be linked to their subsistence lifestyle.Another study published last year in The Journal of Gerontology — led by USC assistant professor Andrei Irimia, also a co-author on the new publication — found that the Tsimane experience less brain atrophy than their American and European peers.Researchers say in contrast to the Tsimane, lifestyle factors in higher-income countries — including lack of physical activity and diets rich in sugars and fats — contribute to heart disease and may also accelerate brain aging.Alzheimer’s research: A race for solutionsAging is the most important known risk factor for Alzheimer’s and other dementias. Converging evidence points to low formal education, midlife hypertension and diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, physical inactivity and — most recently — air pollution as the major modifiable risk factors for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.An aging global population, along with the proliferation of those modifiable risk factors, will lead to a tripling of the number of people with dementia worldwide by 2050, to more than 152 million, according to estimates.“We’re in a race for solutions to the growing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias,” said Hillard Kaplan, a study co-author and professor of health economics and anthropology at Chapman University who has studied the Tsimane for two decades. “Looking at these diverse populations augments and accelerates our understanding of these diseases and generate new insights.”“By working with populations like the Tsimane and the Moseten, we can get a better understanding of global human variation and what human health was like in different environments before industrialization,” said Benjamin Trumble, a study co-author and an associate professor in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change and the Center for Evolution and Medicine at Arizona State University. “What we do know is the sedentary, urban, industrial life is quite novel when compared with how our ancestors lived for more than 99% of humanity’s existence.”Reference: Gatz M, Mack WJ, Chui HC, et al.

‘Absurd’: Brazil awards Bolsonaro ‘medal of Indigenous merit’,"Indigenous leaders slam the award, saying Brazil’s president has promoted policies that threaten their communities.Brazil’s justice ministry has awarded President Jair Bolsonaro the nation’s “medal of Indigenous merit”, drawing sharp criticism from Indigenous leaders who have long accused the far-right leader of promoting policies that have harmed their communities.Justice Minister Anderson Torres awarded the medal to Bolsonaro and 25 other honorees on Wednesday “in recognition of their significant altruistic service for the well-being, protection and defence of indigenous communities”, said a decree published in the official gazette.Torres also granted the medal to himself, Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina, Infrastructure Minister Tarcisio Gomes and Defence Minister Walter Braga Netto.Indigenous leaders and their allies have accused Bolsonaro of trying to force Indigenous peoples in Brazil from their lands, by promoting environmental destruction and allowing rampant deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, home to many Indigenous groups.“Absurd,” tweeted Sonia Guajajara, national coordinator of the Association of Brazil’s Indigenous Peoples (APIB), about Wednesday’s decision.“As if all the reversals we’ve had weren’t enough, this barbaric dis-government has now added another: a medal of merit for Jair Bolsonaro and his allies for their ‘significant’ services to Indigenous peoples,” said Guajajara, adding that her organisation would go to court to block the decree.The Congressional Environmental Front, a legislative bloc often opposed to Bolsonaro, said its leader, lower-house Deputy Alessandro Molon, had filed a motion in Congress to annul the decree.“It is outrageous that the same government that is trying to legalise mining on Indigenous lands, putting these persecuted and mistreated peoples’ very existence at risk, has the nerve to grant itself medals of ‘merit’ for all the ill it has done,” Molon said in a statement.Bolsonaro, who took office in 2019, has cut back environmental enforcement in the Amazon and defunded the government’s Indigenous protection agency, Funai. He has also pushed for more mining and commercial farming in the Amazon to create jobs and reduce poverty.The nation’s medal of Indigenous merit had traditionally been awarded to academics such as anthropologist Darcy Ribeiro or Indigenous leaders such as iconic chief and environmentalist Raoni Matuktire.Brazil is home to approximately one million Indigenous people, about 0.5 percent of the population.Earlier in March, several thousand Brazilians gathered outside Congress to protest against bills backed by Bolsonaro that would weaken environmental protection of the Amazon and allow mining on Indigenous lands.The “Earth Event” was called by popular singer Caetano Veloso and three dozens other Brazilian musicians to call on legislators to stop what they called the “destruction” of the Amazon rainforest.“The situation is critical, this government is destroying what is left of our forests,” said university professor Priscila Borges, adding that Brazil’s environment was endangered by the expansion of farming and a government serving the interests of agribusiness.Environmental activists are also opposed to a bill that will amnesty land grabbers that have for decades illegally invaded lands belonging to the government or traditionally inhabited by Indigenous communities.Other bills would weaken the requirements for environmental licensing and increase the number of pesticides and herbicides that farmers can use.A fourth bill, which the government had hoped to fast-track through Congress arguing that the Ukraine war has disrupted supplies of fertilisers needed for grain crops, would allow mining and oil exploration on Indigenous reservations that are protected by the Constitution.But party whips in the lower house of Congress did not agree to rush to a vote, amid concerns that voters might be angered in an election year.

Interior Department Takes Steps to Increase Voter Registration in Indigenous Communities,"Date: Thursday, March 24, 2022Contact: Interior_Press@ios.doi.govWASHINGTON — The Department of the Interior today announced that it is working with states to formally designate the Department-operated post-secondary Tribal institutions – Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas and the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) in New Mexico – as voter registration agencies under the National Voter Registration Act. This designation will facilitate voter registration opportunities for enrolled students and members of the community.The announcement follows the release of the White House’s Native American Voting Rights Report, which chronicles the barriers Native voters face and recommends actions for policymakers at every level to help break these barriers down.These efforts support President Biden’s Executive Order on Promoting Access to Voting, which aims to expand access to, and education about, voter registration and election information in order to enable all eligible Americans to participate in our democracy.“Tribal nations have played a significant role in influencing the contours of American democracy, yet systemic barriers continue to disenfranchise Indigenous people and impede a free and fair electoral process,” said Secretary Deb Haaland. “The Interior Department is committed to defending the right to vote, which includes increasing access to voter registration and engaging young people in our democratic system.”“Today’s announcement helps further the Administration's goals of increasing voter outreach, education, registration and turnout in Indigenous communities. Haskell and SIPI serve as important touchpoints in their respective communities,” said Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Bryan Newland. “Designating these schools as voter registration agencies is an important move that will allow more Native people the opportunity to register to vote.”In March 2021, President Biden directed the creation of an Interagency Steering Group on Native American Voting Rights to study the barriers Native voters face in casting their ballot and to recommend steps to mitigate or eliminate these barriers. The Steering Group held six consultations with Tribal leaders and Native American voting rights advocates across the country, and engaged in listening sessions with Native Hawaiians, organizations advocating for improved Tribal voting rights, and state and local election officials in jurisdictions with sizable Native populations. These sessions sought ways to mitigate barriers to voting for Native communities and revealed recurring and unnecessary impediments to the franchise.To ensure that the White House report is accessible to a wide audience across Indian Country, the Assistant Secretary’s office is spearheading an effort to translate the report into six Native languages that reflect the regional consultation structure: Navajo, Yup’ik, Ojibwe, Cherokee, Lakota and Native Hawaiian.###"
Indigenous people showing support for Ukraine by wearing ‘kokum scarves’,"Send this page to someone via emailTania Cameron was watching the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from her home in Kenora, Ont., when she felt the need to express her solidarity with Ukrainians on both sides of the world.“There are Ukrainian people in our towns and cities that are having a very hard time. They aren’t my people, but we are connected, so I’ll stand with you,” Cameron said in a phone interview.“If it’s something as simple as wearing a kokum scarf in solidarity, then that’s what I’ll do. If there’s any way I can support funds to help the humanitarian aid, then that’s what I’ll do.”Indigenous people across Canada have been showing their support of Ukraine by posting photos and videos of themselves on social media wearing what is known in many communities as “kokum scarves.”Story continues below advertisementCameron, who is Anishinaabe, saw the social media campaign and decided to join. She sourced the scarves from Indigenous and Ukrainian shops and distributed them Canada-wide at cost. She also held a raffle with proceeds going to the Red Cross.One Ukrainian senior in Kenora found out what Cameron was doing and asked if it was possible for Cameron to hand-deliver some scarves.The two spent some time sharing their histories over coffee.2:23 ‘You need good people’: Canadian man steps up to steer Ukrainians refugees to safety ‘You need good people’: Canadian man steps up to steer Ukrainians refugees to safety – Mar 4, 2022“It was an emotional moment when I was welcomed into her home,” said Cameron.“She gifted me her grandmother’s scarf and gave me sunflower seeds as a way to thank me for my efforts.”The sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine and has become a symbol of peace and solidarity.Story continues below advertisementThe square scarves are often embroidered with bright, floral patterns and have been used historically by kokums, the Cree term for grandmother.Oral history has suggested the scarves were originally brought over to Canada by women from Ukraine and other Slavic countries in the early 1890s when the first Ukrainian settlers came to the country. The scarves are known by various names including khustkas, hustkas or babushkas.Stories of trading between First Nations, Metis and Ukrainian women were passed down through families on all three sides.2:04 Russia’s invasion only partially fuelling sky-high gas prices Russia’s invasion only partially fuelling sky-high gas prices – Mar 4, 2022Cameron recalls wearing a kokum as a child.“We would wear them when we went blueberry picking to try and keep the bugs out of our head and our ears … in the bush in the summertime.”Story continues below advertisementCameron was surprised to learn of the headwear’s origins. She said it makes sense Anishinaabe and Cree women would enjoy them as floral patterns are often present in their artwork.Today, the scarves are often used as a fashion accessory by Indigenous women and men. Powwow dancers incorporate them into their regalia.Traditionally, Slavic women would wear them when they were married and afterwards, said Ukrainian author Marion Mutala. Women would also wear them for protection while they worked outdoors and for different celebrations.Mutala is the author of a children’s series called “Baba’s Babushka,” which is based on her relationship with her own grandmother who died when she was four.About seven years after writing her first book, Mutala met an Indigenous man at a book fair who told her about the significance of the scarf in Indigenous communities.2:15 Moscow defiant as global condemnation of Ukraine invasion heats up Moscow defiant as global condemnation of Ukraine invasion heats up – Mar 4, 2022She decided to research the relationship. Her book “Kohkum’s Babushka” was released in 2017.Story continues below advertisement“I looked at the commonality of the relationship between Indigenous people and Ukrainians. The Metis people have the fiddle and so do Ukrainians. We have a lot of beadwork the same and spiritual life. There’s a lot of similarities,” she said by phone from her home in Saskatoon.Tamara Malcolm remembers using the scarves as a teen when she danced at powwows. The Anishinaabe woman recalls her great-grandmother wearing one but, like Cameron, Malcolm didn’t become aware of the history until recently.Malcolm owns a bead shop on the Serpent River First Nation in northern Ontario.“I have a kokum scarf hanging outside my store to symbolize that I’m in solidarity with Ukraine,” she said.Malcolm started selling the scarves a year ago, but the COVID-19 pandemic stopped large gatherings like powwows, so the items sat on her shelves. Now she’s decided to donate half the proceeds from each scarf to humanitarian efforts for Ukraine and said she has sold nearly 120 of them in the past week. Only a handful are left.This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 5, 2022."
"Almost half the massacres of Aboriginal people were by police or other government forces, research finds","The first national project to record mass killings on the Australian frontier has found that around half of all massacres of Aboriginal people were carried out by police and other government forces. Many others were perpetrated by settlers acting with tacit approval of the state.The final findings of the eight-year long Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project show that conflict was widespread and most massacres were planned, in a deliberate attempt to eradicate Aboriginal people and Aboriginal resistance to the colonisation of the country.Researchers have added 113 sites, mostly from Western Australia and the Northern Territory, in the final stage of the project. There are now 415 sites on the map, each representing a place where six or more people were killed.The most common excuse for a massacre was as a reprisal for the killing a colonist, and the number of people killed was heavily disproportionate. The death of one colonist could result in police-led revenge expeditions that lasted weeks or months. Researchers found that attacks on settlers, while often referred to in historical documents as the reason for a killing, often took place after the alleged “killing of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people, abduction and sexual abuse of women, or livestock’s use of hunting grounds and water”.While numbers should be considered to be indicative rather than exact, the difference in casualties is stark.In an analysis by Guardian Australia based on the data, Aboriginal deaths were estimated to be 27 to 33 times higher than coloniser deaths. Between 11,000 and 14,000 Aboriginal people died, compared with only 399 to 440 colonisers.The tallies of the dead are not the only measure of what took place, according to Dr Bill Pascoe, a digital humanities specialist and key researcher on the project.“We are always using conservative estimates,” Pascoe said. “We want to make sure it can stand up to any kind of criticism that might be thrown at it. We don’t want to be accused of overinflating figures.“Another one of the challenges is objectification. White research objectifies Indigenous people, it’s a big problem, and numbers tend to objectify. So it’s easy just to say 11,000 people [were] killed, and carry on with the next news item … so, one of the main challenges [has been], how can I work against that?”Pascoe said narratives were “one of the most important” parts of the map because they gave a more personal account of events.“[It] helps you think about those people and what they were going through, and some of it is really horrific. Then you add that up, that scale of terror, and for the survivors living after it, and you multiply that by 11,000.”Massacres classified as “opportunity” were the second most common. Most of these attacks were planned, not random clashes, and many had government involvement or were carried out in the knowledge that there would be no formal repercussions.A significant number of massacres took place to “teach the natives a lesson” after the theft of livestock – evidence of the conflict over land, water and resources between settlers and the Aboriginal people they were systematically displacing.Most massacres perpetrated by stockmen and settlers were found in the Northern Territory.Emeritus professor Lyndall Ryan, who led the project, said that stockmen in the NT commonly operated under the orders of big pastoral companies.“Particularly after 1860, it is becoming clear that most of the massacres are being conducted by employees of major companies who are bankrolling these big pastoral leases, or mining leases,” Ryan said.“These companies have more money to arm their employees with good firearms to go out and do their work. It’s not the small selector who’s killing Aboriginal people, it’s these big companies who have experienced overseers, experienced stockmen, to patrol and contain the Aboriginal people.”Massacres after 1890 tended to be carried out over longer periods across broader areas, the researchers found. Ryan described these as “genocidal massacres”.“The code of silence really made it very hard for people to speak. [But] I think a lot of people knew what was going on,” Ryan said.“The newspapers have been an extraordinary source of evidence. What is most interesting about the newspapers is people from northern Australia … would write to the Argus or the Age or [other metropolitan papers] and tell them what was going on. So people in Melbourne knew what was going on.“And the reason why these people from north Queensland will write into the papers in Sydney and Melbourne and Adelaide, is because there were companies based in Melbourne that were bankrolling either mining companies, or pastoral companies in northern Australia.“And so these people who are writing are often employees of those companies. It’s as if they’re reporting to their superiors what is going on.”Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morningResearchers said although the project was complete, there was much more work to be done. Pascoe said he hoped the map would continue to be a reliable resource to “inform public debate”.“That’s an important role for academia, generally, to be a reliable source of information that’s been through some sort of rigorous methodology,” he said. “The intention [is] to present a clearer and an accurate picture of what we can be confident of.”The Killing Times is based on data from the Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project led by Prof Lyndall Ryan at the University of Newcastle’s Centre for the 21st Century Humanities.For more information about the analysis conducted by Guardian Australia and the research methods of the University of Newcastle’s colonial frontier massacres research team, please read the “About” section here.In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

Growing up Maasai and the art of healing the Earth,"For some Indigenous Maasai tribes in Kenya, birdwatching is not so much a leisure activity as it is a survival tactic. The sight of an oxpecker, a gray and white bird with vivid yellow eyes, often indicates that dangerous water buffalos roam nearby. Meanwhile, the brown flash of a honeyguide bird might be the ticket to a calorie-dense meal — these birds can literally guide humans to honey.The honeyguides and oxpeckers of the world illustrate a key tenet of Indigenous knowledge, according to Kimaren ole Riamit, a member of the Maasai community in Kenya. “Nature takes care of us when we take care of it,” said ole Riamit, who has on several occasions followed honeyguides to beehives.Lessons like this are essential as the world faces a crisis of wildlife extinction and climate change. Yet Indigenous knowledge and those who wield it are often an afterthought in major efforts to protect nature, from the Paris Agreement to a big UN treaty on biodiversity loss.Ole Riamit, the executive director of a nonprofit called Indigenous Livelihoods Enhancement Partners, is among the Indigenous leaders pushing to elevate voices like his in these initiatives. He sees himself as a bridge between the Maasai world — an Indigenous world, rooted in nature — and the Western approach to conservation, which has a history of subjugating tribes in Kenya, the US, and elsewhere.He told Vox about growing up in a Maasai community and how the lessons he learned can make wildlife conservation stronger and more equitable. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.A culture of protecting natureBenji JonesWhat was it like growing up in a Maasai community, and what does your Maasai identity mean to you?Kimaren ole RiamitI grew up as a cattle boy, as a herds boy. But I was one of the very few who had the privilege of going to boarding school outside of the community, about 100 kilometers away.Every time I had a break at school, I was herding cattle. I learned which pasture is healthy; which one is poisonous; which one helps cows produce more milk; which one is medicinal. So one of my identities is being connected to the landscape — the savanna pasture land of East Africa.I learned about the different trees and species. I learned which roots are good for food, which fruit is healthy, and when they flower and when they fruit. One of my very strong identities is the Indigenous identity, as people of the land and people of the cattle.Benji JonesWhen I think of these landscapes, I think, perhaps naively, of the iconic animals like giraffes and elephants and lions that live there. Did you have a relationship with these animals growing up?Kimaren ole RiamitYes, and I continue to have a relationship with them. I grew up with elephants, buffaloes, lions, cheetahs, and leopards.I have a brother who lost an eye because he had an encounter with a leopard, which came to steal the goats at night. I was chased by an elephant — I walked right into it in the forest. But I’m here to tell the story. I have a brother whose knee is dislocated because a hyena came into the sheep pen and tried to steal a goat. You are trained to be tough, to withstand pain, to protect the community and the livestock at whatever cost.You need to ask the question: Why is there wildlife here and not in other communities? We have 42 ethnic groups in the country. But the highest density of wildlife is found in these pastoral areas, particularly in Maasailand. For us, it’s difficult to separate culture from nature. Nature is reflected in our culture through rites of passage — through naming ceremonies, circumcision ceremonies, graduation ceremonies when you go from a junior to a senior warrior.There are also animals that reflect clans. You have a clan of the baboon, a clan of the elephant, and a clan of the rhino. How would you kill your clans-mate, the wildlife? There are also taboos and rules about interacting with nature that make sure we use it sustainably.Benji JonesWhat are some of those taboos?Kimaren ole RiamitOne of them is that if you have a lactating cow — a cow that gives milk — it’s taboo to eat game meat, to eat wildlife. You cannot pride yourself on eating game meat. The girls will run away from you. You’re not a respected warrior. Why go kill an antelope when you have an animal in the shed?The same goes for harvesting natural products like herbal trees and medicinal plants. If the active ingredient of an herbal plant is in its roots, you are not allowed to harvest the taproot — the root that goes all the way down. You get the lateral root. And you can’t keep taking roots from one plant until it dies; you move on to the next one.If the active ingredient is in the bark of the tree, you don’t cut a ring out of the bark, because that would suffocate the tree. You create a vertical slit, and you don’t leave it naked — you cover it with soil.The abundance of wildlife speaks to the efficiency of these rules.Benji JonesHow did you learn all of this?Kimaren ole RiamitThe landscape itself is a library of knowledge. As a young boy or girl, when you’re helping your mother fetch water or taking care of the sick, you are told what each plant is for, which ones are poisonous, and what they’re called. When this plant flowers, the rain is around the corner. Indigenous weather forecasting is associated with the behavior of plants and animals. You are in school every day, every moment.Benji JonesYou have a brother who was injured by a leopard. Does that kind of encounter create tension with wildlife?Kimaren ole RiamitYes. When a lion, for example, becomes problematic and develops a taste for cattle meat instead of wild buffalo or eland, the community can organize to kill it. But it’s not a reason to kill all of the lions. When you’re attacked, you try to protect yourself with your traditional spear. You don’t surrender yourself as a snack to the lion. But in general, wild animals have learned to respect our space, and we have learned to respect their space.Benji JonesHave you had any experiences that demonstrate how dependent we are on wildlife and ecosystems?Kimaren ole RiamitYou learn that nature communicates. We learned that the honeyguide bird guides us to honey. They actually make a sound to tell you that they’ve seen a hive. If you know how to respond and follow them, they will take you to it.The bird will look for humans in the landscape close to where the honey is, and then it comes and chirps. Over the years, Indigenous communities have learned the language and how to respond.When you try to harvest the hive, the bees try to finish the honey. They overfeed and become engorged, so they can’t fly. Then the honeyguide feeds on the overfed bees, which can’t sting.Bridging two worldsBenji JonesYou’re working now to bring Indigenous knowledge to the fight against climate change and wildlife extinction. What are some examples of that knowledge?Kimaren ole RiamitI am privileged to belong to two worlds. I belong to the Indigenous world but I also received a formal Western education.One lesson from the Indigenous community is that you take from nature only what you need. You don’t overstock your fridge just to throw food in the dustbin.Another lesson is that nature takes care of us when we take care of it. We have a forest in our community that gives water to the only river that crosses the Maasai Mara [National Reserve]. Our elders set the forest aside because it’s a lifeline — of the people, of wildlife, of the livestock.Benji JonesThe modern conservation movement is rooted in Western ways of knowing. When did you decide you wanted to be a part of that?Kimaren ole RiamitI grew up in a thriving landscape, rich in biodiversity, and I was always connected to the land. When I was going to school as a young boy, I’d cross this stream every morning and arrive dripping wet. Water was always abundant.Then I started noticing things change. I saw that some birds were no more, such as the oxpecker. I can’t remember the last time I heard of a honeyguide. This river that used to flood has been reduced to a stream that a toddler can cross, barely wetting his feet. I saw that the landscape is almost crying.I started questioning what is happening and became aware of climate change. Even the community itself started noticing and saying dry months have stolen water from wet months, and they are not giving the water back. The Indigenous knowledge systems of weather forecasting became disrupted, and our livelihoods are ordered around the weather.Benji JonesA lot of us feel so disconnected from nature, and we are — we get our food from a grocery store, our homes are air-conditioned, and so on. It’s clear that your lives are much more directly dependent on the land.Kimaren ole RiamitOne message we take to the world is that climate change is not a theoretical debate for us. We are on the front lines of the negative impacts of climate change. We see the water disappear.One of the characteristics of the savannas and the rangelands of pastoral communities is that water is scarce. But if you add climate change to that scarcity, you have a severe situation.We just recently had a drought in Kenya. We went for three or four months without rain. Many people’s herds collapsed and died, and building a herd is an intergenerational affair.So for us, climate change is so real.Benji JonesYou went to grad school in Canada. What was it like to learn about wildlife issues or climate change from textbooks and Western professors?Kimaren ole RiamitIt was strange. It felt distant and alien. One of the things that I struggled with is that every study must begin with a theoretical framework. You must think from where somebody else started thinking, and continue from there. But I’m used to observing, I’m used to experiencing things firsthand.I also questioned how conservation was enacted. First came “fortress” conservation, where Indigenous people were pushed out of the land [in the name of protecting wildlife]. The assumption then was that people hate wildlife and are destructive to wildlife.As we struggled with fortress conservation, a new model emerged called community-based conservation. Community-based conservation is what Indigenous communities have been doing for eons. Wildlife is there because communities are living there with it.Then when you introduce a so-called investor into these conservation efforts, who might build a tourist lodge and has instruments of power — privileged knowledge of the market and privileged connections to state organizations. The investor ends up being the conservator, not the community. So while community-based conservation is suddenly a big movement toward appreciating what communities have done and continue to do, a lot of work is still needed to create mutually respectful partnerships.‘Death by recognition’Benji JonesHow was Indigenous knowledge perceived when you were learning about conservation?Kimaren ole RiamitIndigenous knowledge was perceived as inferior knowledge. It was perceived as nonrigorous knowledge because it’s nonscientific — because it’s not documented. Never mind that scientific books are written by interviewing and researching in the field and getting knowledge from these communities, and so on. And when those books are written, this knowledge is privatized.While Kenya is certainly progressing, the institution in charge of Indigenous knowledge is the national museums. There’s an idea that this knowledge should be preserved in the archives. It’s not active knowledge. It’s something to be gazed at, to be frozen in time.Benji JonesWhen you look at the major efforts to protect nature today — I’m thinking about the UN Paris Agreement or the new global effort to protect 30 percent of all land and water by 2030 — what role do Indigenous communities play in shaping these initiatives?Kimaren ole RiamitWhen you look at the Convention on Biological Diversity or the Sustainable Development Goals or the Paris Agreement, Indigenous people have managed to put placeholders in these decisions. For example, there’s recognition [in these initiatives] that Indigenous knowledge should inform climate change adaptation and mitigation. We have put in a placeholder that says Indigenous knowledge is grounded in collective land tenure.But these placeholders are just text that speaks to these issues. They mean nothing if they’re not cascading down and translated into action.Benji JonesSo, these international climate and biodiversity treaties mention Indigenous people and land tenure — meaning, the right to land — but that’s not the same as action on the ground.Kimaren ole RiamitExactly. Sometimes I call this “death by recognition.” The reality of the matter is that Indigenous people are not saying, “Write about us on paper.” They’re saying, “Address our human rights, give Indigenous knowledge space in planning and development, and allow us to sit at the decision-making table.”They are saying, “Put resources in our hands because we are aware of the issue; we understand where it hurts. We can direct these resources to strategic actions now.”Benji JonesRight now there is a lot of money flowing into climate initiatives and into biodiversity efforts as well. Is that making its way into Indigenous communities?Kimaren ole RiamitOne of the challenges for Indigenous people is access to resources. Most of the resources come indirectly — it’s a very layered process and each layer takes a chunk of those resources. Very little arrives in the hands of our communities.And much of the money comes by way of small grants. Why small? There is this notion that Indigenous people have no capacity to manage big grants. How would they grow to manage big grants if they can’t flex their muscles to manage big grants like everybody else?Funds for climate change also often target specific landscapes like the Amazon or Congo Basin. These are not the only landscapes sequestering carbon. What about savanna woodlands? Savanna woodlands here sequester the most carbon.Benji JonesWhat would you do with endless resources for conservation?Kimaren ole RiamitFor pastoral communities, a big issue is access to water, which determines whether cattle can use a certain pasture. So I would strengthen the community’s access to water.When you look at the issue of drought and dying herds, one way to help is by securing land tenure. It’s a technical process that requires cartographers and maps and other kinds of resources. Land tenure affects how Indigenous communities adapt to climate change and use the land.We have learned that the State only understands the language of paper — it doesn’t communicate by spoken words, orally. Maybe we have talked too much about our Indigenous knowledge without documenting it. So we should document this knowledge and practices that are relevant to conservation, relevant to sustainable use, and relevant to climate resilience.Benji JonesWhat would it mean to you to bridge the gap between the Indigenous and Western worlds? What is your vision for conservation?Kimaren ole RiamitI recognize the constraints of a crowded planet that needs to feed its growing population. But I also think we can develop integrated visions for how we relate to nature. The world will be a better place if multiple knowledge systems speak to each other, if they inform each other. We need space for mutual respect, for hearing each other out without prejudice, for not privileging some knowledge systems over others."
"In Climate Research, Arctic Scientists and Indigenous People Join Forces","Climate scientists in the Arctic often conduct their fieldwork without input from the region’s Indigenous residents, some 1.13 million people including the Inuit in Alaska, Canada and Greenland and the Sami in Finland, Sweden and Norway.But a shift in thinking in scientific circles and in the agencies that guide and fund scientific research—including the National Science Foundation and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy—augurs a new era of collaboration between the region’s first residents and the researchers studying climatic and environmental changes now occurring at the top of the world."
Prince Rupert Indigenous Justice Centre reaching out to all of North Coast,"Clarence Martin, on March 25, is the new community outreach coordinator for the Prince Rupert Indigenous Justice Centre. (Photo: Norman Galimski/The Northern View)Clarence Martin, his traditional Nisga’a Belx Sim Sgii, has rounded out the Prince Rupert Indigenous Justice Centre (PRIJC) as the new community outreach coordinator, enabling the organization to be fully staffed after moving to a new location in the summer of 2021.Taking over the role from Rudy Kelly on Jan. 31, Martin aims to improve the reach of the centre across the North Coast. Previously a court worker in the 1970s, Martin helped to “demystify” the legal system for indigenous clients. He hopes to use his experience to better serve Indigenous communities on the North Coast.The first step to accomplishing this goal is gathering as much information from across the region as possible. For the first time, the PRIJC will have a booth at the All Native Basketball Tournament to introduce themselves to the broader community and collect information through a survey.Martin, previously chairman of the tournament for many years, knows how far-reaching the event is in the region. He hopes to maximize the exposure it can bring to the people who can benefit from the centre’s services.The team wants to learn how much North Coast communities know about their services, who and where those people are in the region and collect the information they still may be lacking to better serve the area.With more complete information on the area, they will be able to better serve and address the issues of the region, Martin said. In the future, Martin’s role will be to visit Port Hardy, Haida Gwaii and other coastal communities. He said he wants communities to become stronger.The centre’s team also consists of a Gladue worker, Gladue report writer, two legal assistants and a lawyer.A Gladue worker and writer create a report detailing the unique life circumstances of an Indigenous person charged with a criminal offence who is applying for bail and is being sentenced. The Gladue report will link the life story of an Indigenous offender to the broader issues facing Indigenous people. It will provide detailed recommendations for the judge to consider in terms of sentencing.The PRIJC offers culturally-safe free legal services to indigenous people in Prince Rupert and North Coast. They provide legal advice and representation for child protection matters, criminal charges and other legal issues.READ MORE: Prince Rupert Indigenous Justice Centre expands team and grows into new officeNorman Galimski | JournalistemailLike the The Northern View on FacebookFollow us on Twitter Send NormanLike theonFollow us onCity of Prince RupertIndigenousLaw & Justice"
Sydney is no place to build a Māori meeting house - it is disrespectful to Aboriginal people,"When most New Zealanders hear the term “marae” they think of the typical Māori meeting house.The angular facade, decorated in red and white carvings, and the open space for the “encounter” where guests arrive in the warmth of welcome, in the grief of a tangi (funeral), or in the uncertainty of a disagreement.Technically, the “marae” refers to that open space, but most people assume it means the meeting house. In most parts of the North Island, marae – taking the common meaning of the meeting house and the open space – dot small, rural communities. In Te Teko, where I trace my whakapapa (ancestry), there are four marae within a couple kilometres of each other.Each marae on that golden mile in Te Teko acts as a physical statement – this is Māori land. Marae embody deep connections to the land and to the ancestors who exercised rights and responsibilities in respect of it. They make perfect sense in New Zealand.But in Australia, where the Sydney Marae Alliance are preparing to construct that country’s first marae, they make no sense. In a landmark deal the Alliance are planning a $4m facility in Greystanes, a suburb in western Sydney. For the 65,000 Māori who call New South Wales home the soon-to-be marae will act as a tangible connection to their ancestral home, creating a space for Māori culture to thrive on a foreign land.“Foreign” is the operative word, though. Marae are a statement of indigeneity. In Te Teko, the marae on the golden mile signal a deeper, longer connection to the land than the Pākehā farms and towns that surround them. But in Australia Māori aren’t indigenous. Māori are indigenous to New Zealand.And that distinction is at the heart of the matter. In Australia, Aboriginal peoples are Indigenous. In Greystanes, the Darug are the people who maintain an ancient connection to the land and exercise their rights and responsibilities in respect of it. In the more than 60,000-year history of Aboriginal peoples, Māori – arriving in Sydney shortly after white settlement – are Johnnies-come-lately. Can the Māori community in NSW really call on a connection deep enough to justify a marae?The Alliance point to the 19th-century farm that one rangatira (Māori chief) maintained in the area as well as the Reverend Samuel Marsden’s former seminary for Māori only eight kilometres from the proposed site. There are Māori ancestors buried in and around what is, today, western Sydney. But on that logic we could also rationalise the monuments to European imperialism – from statues to churches to prisons – on the basis that white settlers can point to a few hundred years in Australia as well. None of this is enough to make Māori or Europeans indigenous to Australia because Indigenous people already exist. Building a marae would form part of a grim history of erasing Aboriginal indigeneity.None of this is to suggest the Alliance is acting in bad faith. The facility in Greystanes forms one part of several proposals to construct marae in Australia. In 2010 a proposal was made for a marae in Melbourne, and then one for Western Australia in 2013. Māori in Australia obviously yearn for a space where they can just be Māori.But the answer to that yearning is rather obvious – if you want a marae, return to New Zealand. If you want a space to be Māori, build a community centre or lease a hall. The carvings that decorate marae are another statement of belonging, telling the story of an indigenous people and their connection to the land in question. But whose stories will the carvings in Greystanes tell?The Alliance confirm that they’ve sought and won support from Darug elders for their marae. Again, this indicates the good faith in which the proposal was created, but it still doesn’t address the “indigenous” question.Mamari Stephens illustrates this well when recounting the opening ceremony for a pou – a carving that communicates a certain meaning, in this context a welcome and connection to New Zealand – in the south Pacific garden in the Nurragingy Reserve where (quite wrongly) Māori took on the role of welcoming the visitors. That might seem harmless, but the visitors appeared to include members of the Darug community. In this context Māori can never be indigenous, and so they should never take on the traditional (in New Zealand) role of welcoming the actual Indigenous people – the Darug – in a powhiri on to their own land."
Indigenous-owned travel agency officially launched in Winnipeg,"A new travel agency that is entirely Indigenous-owned is officially up and running.Indigeno Travel formally launched during a ceremony Wednesday morning at its Winnipeg headquarters. The company, a partnership with Treaty One Development Corporation, Great Canadian Travel, and Continental Travel Group, will create travel and tourism career opportunities and revenue for Indigenous people across Canada.“I really loved the concept, the idea of what that would mean for Indigenous people here in this country,” said Chief Dennis Meeches of Long Plain First Nation. “I believe there are a lot of opportunities for all our people, Indigenous, non-Indigenous that we work with, to create such a company.The company is for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to use.“No matter where you are, or where you’re going, Indigeno is for all of us,” said Charlene Phillips, part-owner of Indigeno.In addition to helping book travel, the company is also working to develop Indigenous tourism experiences across Canada.“With our connections around the world, we could send Indigenous tourism experiences to over 7,000 agents and agencies all around the world,” said Chris Maxfield, one of the founders of Indigeno “So our goal, our challenge, is to develop those, get them what we call export ready to go, and bring the world to Canada.”The company said its development will also help facilitate the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s 92nd Call to Action, with regards to reconciliation through business."

New book looks at economic reconciliation between Indigenous people and the resource sector,"'Weaving two worlds' looks at the resource sector's role within advancing reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous poeple.A new book by an Indigenous leader and a resource industry executive lays-out their vision for a new way forward: one in which the resource sector plays a meaningful role in advancing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.Weaving two worlds, written by K’ómoks First Nation member and vice-president of Indigenous and stakeholder engagement at Falkirk Environmental Consultants, Christy Smith, and the founding partner and co-chair of Falkirk and past president and CEO of the Mining Association of B.C., Michael McPhie, is a call for change, as the resource sector’s relationship with Indigenous people has often been marked by protests, distrust, and anger.Smith and McPhie offer their two voices of two worlds—Indigenous and non-Indigenous—to deliver insights, knowledge and guidance from their decades of work between resources companies and Indigenous communities.“Since being involved in this practice area, I have recognized that those who build sincere relationships and gain trust have better success, while those who come in and want to check a box may as well walk away,” Smith said.The authors look to case studies and personal stories to offer practical skills and tips on how to build meaningful, mutually productive relationships with Indigenous Peoples, from initial consultation to project planning and development. The book also explains how the resource sector can play a meaningful role in advancing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, as part of a sustainable future.“Having served at almost level within the resource industry, I have seen that the success, or lack thereof, of a project, policy, or initiative, always comes down to people and how they are treated and involved in decisions that affect them,” McPhie said.Released earlier this month, Weaving two worlds is on sale now and more information can be found here."
"Sudden deaths of 15 Indigenous people in Thunder Bay require further action, report on police service says","The sudden deaths of 15 Indigenous people in Thunder Bay require further investigation by police or the coroner’s office, including that of a two-month-old baby with cocaine in its system, investigators in Ontario say in a report that follows two investigations that found racism in the local force.A secondary report that will not be made public recommends an external review of 25 unsolved cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls at the Thunder Bay Police Service’s criminal investigation branch.The main report was delivered last week to the Office of the Independent Police Review Director (OIPRD), the police board and Ontario’s Ministry of the Attorney-General. It has not yet been made public. It contains case summaries and comprehensive accounts of nine sudden deaths of Indigenous people that were reinvestigated, and cites shortcomings in police work, and a lack of documentation and coroner involvement.The recommendation for a review of the cases of missing women and girls is part of a confidential report investigators produced that is not in the final report to the OIPRD.Both reports were obtained by The Globe and Mail.The local police force and police board had already been investigated twice, after an inquest into the deaths of seven First Nations high-school students ended in 2016. Gerry McNeilly of the OIPRD found in a report called Broken Trust that the force was guilty of systemic racism. It said Indigenous people were both over- and under-policed.The second investigation, led by former senator Murray Sinclair, dissolved the board, also accusing it of racism and of failing to police the force.Attorney-General spokesperson Brian Gray confirmed in an e-mail the ministry received the new, 42-page report, and a request from the committee that oversaw the work to refer 16 deaths for reinvestigation, including one of a non-Indigenous person.Ontario Provincial Police open criminal investigation into Thunder Bay police service membersMr. Gray said the ministry will determine the next steps, including notification of families “at the appropriate time and in consultation with the police service and victim services.”The report – which will be released once all families receive copies – addresses four of the 2018 Broken Trust report’s recommendations.The committee included retired justice Stephen Goudge, Ontario Chief Coroner Dirk Huyer, Thunder Bay Police Chief Sylvie Hauth, chief provincial forensic pathologist Michael Pollanen and First Nations elder Helen Cromarty. The group also included Irene Linklater, a representative of Nishnawbe Aski Nation, a political organization for about 49 mostly remote First Nations in the region.A team of investigators led by retired Ontario Provincial Police superintendent Ken Leppert was tasked with reinvestigating the nine sudden deaths, identifying any additional cases that should be looked at again, and determining if the death in 2015 of Stacy DeBungee needed to be reinvestigated.Mr. Huyer announced last June that the Ministry of the Attorney-General had asked the OPP to take on Mr. DeBungee’s case after initial work from the Broken Trust investigators.Mr. DeBungee’s death spurred the Broken Trust probe, after his family and the community of Rainy River First Nation brought concerns to the OIPRD that police prematurely determined it was an accident because he was Indigenous and intoxicated. His body was found in a city river.In the confidential report to the committee, the Broken Trust investigators said they reviewed 229 cases of concern from Thunder Bay Police Service and Ontario chief coroner’s records between 2003 and 2017, identifying 14 sudden deaths for further police investigation and two cases for a coroner’s review as a matter of public safety relating to missing persons and toxic drug deaths. All but one of the 16 people who died were Indigenous, 10 were women, and with the exception of the two-month-old baby, all were between the ages of 22 and 61.Investigators reported that the baby’s cause and manner of death was undetermined, and if evidence had been collected properly, should have been investigated as possible criminal negligence causing death. The baby was found unresponsive in an apartment, pronounced dead at hospital, and police at the time were aware of previous abuse allegations against the parents, and another small child in the home, Broken Trust investigators said.Investigators also recommended an external audit of the police service’s records management system, citing a “high volume of inconsistent classifications of sudden-death investigations, inconsistent records management, poor documentation of records and concerning cases that may require additional review.”Comprehensive reports on each of the nine cases reinvestigated outlined the original Thunder Bay Police Service findings, and the process of the reinvestigations, including the independent review of records and evidence by members of the Broken Trust investigative resource committee that comprised Indigenous pathologists and coroners. Some witness names and other details were redacted from copies shared with families and their representatives.Four of the nine reinvestigated cases were of youth whose deaths were examined in a 2015 coroner’s inquest into the cases of seven First Nations students attending high school in Thunder Bay when they died between 2000-2011. Their families and communities at the time voiced concerns that police had not investigated cases thoroughly because the people who died were Indigenous, such as the disappearance of 15-year-old Jethro Anderson, initially brushed off as a youth who was just out partying. Police found his body in the Kaministiquia River and concluded he drowned. The 2015 inquest jury also concluded he died by drowning, but could not determine how his death came about.Ontario Civilian Police Commission to investigate Thunder Bay Police brassBroken Trust investigators found fault with the way the cases were investigated, but concluded no changes were needed in the causes and manner of death for Mr. Anderson and the other three students from the inquest, Curran Strang, Kyle Morriseau and Jordan Wabasse.Findings in only one of the nine cases resulted in a change of cause and manner of death.Caitlyn Kasper, a lawyer for Mr. Anderson’s family and two others, said there’s been little transparency, follow-through or communication from the committee to the families about what will be made public in the final report. She said initially the final report was to include their feedback about the process, which they’ve outlined in 18 pages detailing what she called “repeated failures to provide adequate and effective communication and police services to the communities.”Ms. Kasper is with Aboriginal Legal Services in Toronto.She said the families received the investigative reports for Mr. Anderson, Mr. Morriseau and Mr. Wabasse from the committee in December, months after it met with them to discuss the findings. At that time, they were left with little information and nothing on paper. Ms. Kasper said when they finally received the reports, each about 30 pages, they were mostly redacted and “overwhelmingly, did not shed any new light on anything.”She said if the committee knew that’s what the outcome would be, the families should have been told sooner.Ms. Kasper said Broken Trust was supposed to restore confidence and build relationships between Thunder Bay police and Indigenous communities and families.“That is certainly not what we have seen at all,” she said.She added that the continued systemic injustices against Indigenous people are frustrating, given the number of interventions over the past five years.Mr. Huyer has said the committee experienced significant delays, including travel to the families’ communities for interviews, because of the pandemic.A separate report done independently from the committee will make recommendations based on the nine reinvestigations, lessons learned and input from families and Broken Trust team members.“Evidence of systemic racism was recognized during the reinvestigation process as well as restriction of information and failure to equally share information with all investigative members, including the [committee],” Justice Goudge said in the report to the OIPRD.He said the authors of the report faced “a challenging environment … to conduct their work in a meaningful, culturally safe manner.”Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

Inuit leader says Vatican Museums open to repatriating Indigenous artifacts,"Many of the Indigenous delegates meeting the Pope this week finished a private tour of the Vatican Museums yesterday disappointed, but the leader of the Inuit delegation says he was told by the curator of the Ethnological Museum that the Vatican is open to returning precious cultural belongings it has in its possession.Natan Obed, president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), met with Father Nicola Mapelli for a couple of hours at Obed's request after touring the museums, including the Sistine Chapel and some of the Indigenous cultural items from Canada in a new Anima Mundi exhibit that is not open to the public yet.""The curator was quite open to any scenario that we proposed, including repatriation,"" Obed said.""Nothing is off the table, as they have said to us.""The delegates saw just a portion of the Vatican's collection of Indigenous pieces, including a rare kayak about a century old from Inuvialuit in the Western Arctic.ITK board member Duane Smith, who is also the chair and CEO of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, last year called on the Vatican to return the kayak to Inuit. Smith declined to join this month's delegation to Rome.During Obed's conversation with Mapelli, the curator spoke about how the Vatican Museums worked with a number of different Indigenous Peoples, most recently in Australia, to decide what's best for the pieces that the Vatican has in its holdings, Obed said.Curator describes kayak records to Natan ObedThe backstory of how the kayak got to the Vatican is still a mystery.The Vatican says it was part of a 1925 exhibition of tens of thousands of Indigenous cultural artifacts sent in by church missionaries from around the world, but the question of who made it, which community it came from and whether it was gifted is still unclear.Obed doesn't know all the details but was told it was part of a call for examples of cultural expression against fascism, nazism and racism in the early 20th century.""The kayak is beautiful,"" Obed said. ""It is a wonderful expression of our culture and craftsmanship, and it was really nice to see it.""WATCH | Métis and Inuit leaders describe meeting Pope Francis:Indigenous leaders reflect on talks with Pope Duration 6:10 Two leaders of the Indigenous delegation in Rome describe their experiences meeting Pope Francis for historic reconciliation talks and what they hope will come out of the discussions. 6:10Mapelli has some records that show the kayak came from Edmonton before it went to Vatican City by boat across the Atlantic Ocean and didn't show any visible signs of wear once it arrived.Obed said further conversations need to take place on what happens next to the kayak and other cultural pieces, which includes connecting Mapelli with Smith.""I do hope that the best possible decisions can be made about these pieces, which are important,"" Obed said.Other delegates, who want to see their cultural pieces repatriated, are upset with the way the Vatican is showcasing their history and are demanding to be involved in decisions moving forward.No mention of residential schools at Indigenous exhibitFirst Nations delegate Norman Yakeleya, whose traditional last name is Yakeula, from the Dene Nation in the Northwest Territories said he was disturbed after seeing a sacred ceremonial pipe the Vatican exhibited.""I've been told by some elders that it's not for show,"" Yakeleya said. ""It was there on display, and it was something that I didn't feel good about.Yakeleya says the artifacts should be repatriated to their rightful owners: the ceremonial people.""They can make plastic models if they want, but give us the real thing,"" Yakeleya said.""For God's sakes, give them back to our people.""Norman Yakeleya, whose traditional last name is Yakeula, is a residential school survivor who would like to see the objects in the Vatican's collection of Indigenous artifacts returned to the communities they came from.

Innovative atlas puts Indigenous knowledge on the map - literally - to help tackle climate crisis,"Hetxw'ms Gyetxw spent his childhood on Gitxsan territory in the Northwest Interior of British Columbia, and he's seen the dramatic ways climate change has altered the land where he grew up. The river he used to skate on no longer freezes over. The glaciers he remembers have disappeared.""We've watched the world change,"" Hetxw'ms Gyetxw said in an interview. ""I'm going to be 40 this year, but in my lifetime I have watched our land change completely.""Hetxw'ms Gyetxw is Gitxsan, a matrilineal society which doesn't use last names. He goes by his full traditional name.Now living in Winnipeg with his family, Hetxw'ms Gyetxw has used his first-hand experience to bridge the gap between Indigenous knowledge and Western science, and to help create a new interactive tool aimed at understanding and addressing climate change in Canada.The Indigenous Knowledges component of the Climate Atlas of Canada, launched today, is the culmination of years of work by Hetxw'ms Gyetxw and the team at the University of Winnipeg's Prairie Climate Centre, in collaboration with Indigenous communities across the country.Hetxw'ms Gyetxw, seen here in a childhood photo with his grandparents, used to skate on this river in the winter. Now, he says, the Xsyeen River in B.C.'s Northwest Interior rarely freezes over. (Submitted by Hetxw'ms Gyetxw)Launching a new map of Canada""We've launched a new map of Canada,"" Ian Mauro, executive director of the Prairie Climate Centre, said in an interview.Until now, the interactive atlas did not show climate change projections for Indigenous communities. Only Canadian urban centres were included.The newly-launched feature provides information about the impacts of climate change on 634 First Nations communities and 53 Inuit communities, while also profiling projects surrounding climate change adaptation and mitigation across the Métis homeland.The map also shares videos from Indigenous elders and knowledge keepers, centring their knowledge as a resource. It highlights projects aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions, such as the Cowessess First Nation wind-solar battery storage project in Saskatchewan, and community efforts to adapt to climate change, like the Métis wildland firefighters.Mauro, who is not Indigenous, said it was important for him as a geographer to help put Indigenous communities on the map — literally in some cases — and work toward reconciliation.""It's a massive contribution from Indigenous communities to all of Canada … to think about a different way of approaching this hugely complex issue that is grounded in that millennia-old yet current and modern Indigenous wisdom,"" he said.WATCH | How the Indigenous knowledges section of the Climate Atlas works:Indigenous knowledge not just about the pastThe unique approach illustrates how Western or Eurocentric climate change science and Indigenous expertise can complement one another. It's the embodiment of a concept sometimes called two-eyed seeing, which Hetxw'ms Gyetxw describes:""Through one eye you're looking at the world through the Western sciences and the other eye you're looking through traditional knowledges … you're taking all perspectives and you're seeing the world as it truly is, not just in one segmented way.""Hetxw'ms Gyetxw said Indigenous knowledge is often stereotyped as only being about the past, or relegated to topics like hunting and fishing. He hopes this new tool will help Canadians see the bigger picture.""Indigenous knowledge encompasses everything,"" he said. ""It encompasses the weather, it encompasses what things are going to look like in the future.

(Simon Fraser University)Siila Watt-Cloutier, an Inuk climate advocate, was a key partner in the development of the Indigenous content on the Climate Atlas.She said climate change has had a dramatic impact on the daily lives of Inuit. The thinning ice makes the conditions difficult to read, and even seasoned hunters have fallen through. The thawing permafrost has hurt infrastructure — leading to airport runways buckling and in some cases, homes built on stilts warping.According to projections from the Climate Atlas, her home town of Kuujjuaq in Nunavik, an autonomous region of Northern Quebec, is expected to have an average of 40 fewer days a year where temperatures drop below 0 C by the end of the century, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase at the same rate. These higher temperatures would greatly impact the Inuit community where life depends on the ice.But instead of only seeing Indigenous people as victims of climate change, Watt-Cloutier said it's time for the world to look to them as problem solvers.""We are after all, the inventors of the kayak, the boat that is replicated worldwide. We can build homes of snow, warm enough for your mothers to birth in. This is ingenuity architecture at its very best,"" said Watt-Cloutier, who is an officer of the Order of Canada and a Nobel Peace Prize nominee.She said much of the world seems to be stuck in a ""paralysis of analysis"" when it comes to addressing the climate crisis, but that Inuit and other Indigenous people can help lead.""We want to be there at the tables negotiating. We want to be there teaching the world what is happening and how we can move forward.""""We have much to give and we have much to offer.

How Indigenous people are rebuilding child welfare to lift up the whole family,"In their efforts to heal the damage done to Indigenous kids by Canada's foster care systems, members of Cowessess First Nation are building their own child welfare program rooted in the idea of keeping a ""home fire"" burning to connect children to their culture and community.""[The home fire] doesn't necessarily mean bringing all the children back home, but it … starts with that culture, feeling the land, remembering who you are and where you come from,"" said Nicole Cook, the associate CEO of the Chief Red Bear Children's Lodge, the new Cowessess-run child and family services agency on the Saskatchewan reserve.The community was in the spotlight last year after experts found what's believed to be 751 unmarked graves at the site of the former Marieval Residential School. It's the first to make use of Bill C-92, federal legislation passed in June 2019, which gives jurisdiction over child welfare back to First Nations.Cowessess is working to change a system that critics say has notoriously harmed Indigenous children and families, first with residential schools, then with the Sixties Scoop and since then through child and family services and foster care. While Indigenous children make up only 7.7 percent of the child population in Canada, Statistics Canada data shows that 52.2 percent of children in foster care are Indigenous.In January the federal government announced an agreement to spend $40 billion to reform child welfare on reserves and compensate those who've been harmed. Between this agreement and Bill C-92, advocates now have more tools to repair or rebuild child welfare.Nicole Cook is the associate CEO of Chief Red Bear Children's Lodge on Cowessess First Nation. (Courtney Markewich/CBC News)Cook is a member of Cowessess, but didn't grow up in her community or with her Cree culture. She discovered the grounding effects of her own ""home fire"" when she came home and reconnected to the land as an adult.""When I was able to walk the land that my kookum [grandmother] lived on, [it] had this huge impact on me,"" she said. ""And I think that's what we need to build [our work] out of.""Cook is part of a growing team of nurses and early childhood educators who are starting from scratch to create a new system for Cowessess children and their families.That team includes Eva Coles, who became CEO of Chief Red Bear Lodge in 2020 after more than three decades working in child and family services for First Nation and Métis organizations. She said the transfer of jurisdiction from the federal government to Cowessess gives the First Nation the same powers that, for instance, a province would have.""This is the inherent right of Cowessess to do this,"" she said. ""We're now just transferring everything over that … was always ours.""Family care systemIn the year that the organization has been in operation, Coles and her team have been able to work with families to keep everyone together when there's been the need for child welfare involvement, she said. Families are offered counselling, life-skills training and other supports, including the time and space to sleep and get some good food in their bellies before talking about what's going on.They're trying to create a family care system, not just a child welfare system — and it seems to be working.""[Even though] we're not even [at] our first year anniversary yet, there are no children in care on the Cowessess reserve at this moment in time,"" Coles said. ""It's zero.""Dancers perform at a powwow during a Reconciliation Day event in Cowessess First Nation on Thursday, the first National Day of Truth and Reconciliation. (Liam Richards/The Canadian Press)They're also trying to identify and connect with as many Cowessess children living off reserve as they can. Coles said they believe most are living elsewhere in Saskatchewan or the other prairie provinces, but some are farther from home.""We're getting to know each child, one by one and figuring out what their needs [are],"" Coles said. ""So some children … just need their genealogy. They don't know who they're related to. Other children need someone to just give them a call, sometimes a picture of the reserve.""However, Coles and her team did identify a small group of children in New Brunswick who she says didn't have the support they needed. On April 1, 2021, the first day they were able to assert jurisdiction, they brought those children back to Cowessess.""We were able to just get them on the plane with their grandpa and get them home and straight into grandma and grandpa's house,"" she said. ""It was the least and smallest thing that we could do to start this off.""Helping parents in Winnipeg's North EndThough Cowessess is the first Indigenous community to make use of Bill C-92, elsewhere in Canada other organizations and individuals are also working to improve the experiences of those who come into contact with the system.Mary Burton is one of those advocates. The Winnipeg resident is a Sixties Scoop survivor and the guardian of grandchildren who were briefly in the foster care system.Burton spent eight years in foster homes as a child, and the bullying, threats and insults she experienced led her to become a strong voice for parents.""I had to put up with being told by the agency that I'm going to end up growing up being a prostitute and [I'll be] hooked on drugs and alcohol, because all Indian girls are good for is getting high and drunk,"" Burton said.Mary Burton, right, is the executive director of Fearless R2W, a Winnipeg group that works to support families involved in the child and family services system.

Canada continues to ‘perform’ Indigenous reconciliation: report,"Canada is continuing to “perform” reconciliation for the sake of its own reputation rather than implementing structural changes that would “rectify ongoing harms” and change the “disparate realities” that Indigenous peoples face in Canada, a recent report from the Yellowhead Institute charges.This comes six years after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) released its Final Report and 94 Calls to Action with the goal of remedying the legacy of residential schools and advancing reconciliation.Last year, Canada implemented three calls from the report — more within three weeks than in the previous three years, according to the December 2021 report. In June alone, Canada appointed a language commissioner (No. 15), named a National Day for Truth and Reconciliation (No. 80) and changed the Oath of Citizenship (No. 94).Not a single call to action was completed in 2020, and 83 calls remain incomplete, it finds.While these calls were implemented with rapid speed, the report emphasizes that they came on the heels of deeply disturbing news that made international headlines: hundreds of children’s graves had been confirmed at a number of former residential schools.“Where ‘reconciliation’ happened this year, it was in response to pressure brought to bear by all of the international attention focusing on this growing evidence of Canada’s history of genocide,” the report reads.In 2015, the TRC published the circumstances of the deaths of more than 3,000 children in a volume of its final report titled, “Missing Children and Unmarked Burials.” That same year, Justice Murray Sinclair, who headed the report, had estimated up to 6,000 deaths at residential schools.While the general public was shocked to hear about the unmarked graves, survivors had been sharing testimonies about deaths at the institutions for decades, co-author Ian Mosby, a historian and associate professor at X University told the Star. He adds that Indigenous people have needed “proof beyond proof” for Canada to believe them.“It’s been six years. We should see the fruits of it by now,” Mosby said.The report also charges that throughout the years, the federal government has chosen to focus on implementing the calls that are “arguably the easiest” — the symbolic gestures — “while neglecting the structural changes called for by the TRC.”“If morbid and traumatizing revelations of Indigenous children’s graves advanced completion on Calls to Action that are only symbolic, what will have to happen for Canada to complete Calls to Action that are substantive?” the report asks.In an emailed statement to the Star, a Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada spokesperson told the Star that implementing the TRC calls to action is a “vital part of the Government of Canada’s work to advance reconciliation,” adding that while this work is “front and centre” to that of Crown-Indigenous Relations, all departments are involved.“We recognize that there is still much work to be done and will continue this critical work in partnership with Indigenous Peoples, encouraging all Canadians to learn about the Calls to Action and how they can contribute to advancing reconciliation,” spokesperson Kyle Fournier wrote.Fournier adds that “recent progress” has also been made on Calls to Action 41, 43, 53 and 74 to 76, which includes release of the 2021 National Action Plan: Ending Violence Against Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+, new legislation that “provides a pathway” towards the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and an inaugural meeting in December on a committee meant to create a National Council for Reconciliation.Additionally, Fournier says that Canada is urgently deploying money to Indigenous partners and communities to locate and commemorate or memorialize missing children who attended residential schools, with $116.8 million committed to date.But in Mosby’s view, “Canada hasn’t even started” the process of reconciliation.He says that can only begin when Canada tells the truth, meaning it has to first complete the calls to action that require the federal government to publish annual reports on systems and structures that are harming Indigenous people. That includes publishing yearly reports on child welfare (No. 2), education (No. 9) health outcomes (No. 19), and Indigenous overrepresentation in jails and prisons (No. 30).He says that without those reports, it’s impossible to measure further progress.Canada is acting as though reconciliation can be achieved “via a crude colonial balance sheet: once a Call to Action is complete, Canadians can then forget about it and feel better about themselves,” the report reads. “We remind Canada that relationality — which, to our mind, is what reconciliation is trying to achieve — is an ongoing process, not a single event or box to check.”Additionally, some truth has only been uncovered because Indigenous people have fought for it, experts say. “So much Indigenous labour has been taken up just trying to make people aware,” report co-author Eva Jewell told the Star.Jewell, who is a research director at Yellowhead and an assistant professor in X University’s sociology department, adds that it’s telling that unmarked graves are still being found after the reconciliation agenda has been established, rather than before.In January, Williams Lake First Nation announced that an investigation that used ground-penetrating radar had found 93 potential unmarked graves near a historic cemetery at a former residential school. Two weeks ago, 54 potential graves were found on residential schools on Keeseekoose First Nation. Today, 169 potential graves have been found at a former residential school, Kapawe’no First Nation in northern Alberta said. It’s the latest development in dozens of similar investigations being conducted by First Nations themselves.Other “low points” in the report includes the continued lack of access to clean drinking water for many First Nations communities despite promises of change; the Liberal government’s court battle against St. Anne’s Residential School survivors; the construction of a pipeline on Wet’suwet’en territory without consent of the traditional hereditary chiefs; and Trudeau’s trip to Tofino on the first National Day of Truth and Reconciliation.“It’s worth noting that boil water advisories are not even mentioned in the Calls to Action because they shouldn’t need to be: clean water is a basic human right that non-Indigenous people in Canada are able to take for granted,” the report reads.Also among the low points: the Liberal government’s continued appeal of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal orders to compensate First Nations children for the discriminatory underfunding of social services for them. On Jan. 4, Ottawa revealed a historic $40-billion agreement-in-principle that would see $20 billion allocated to compensation and another $20 billion to spend over the next five years to improve child and family services for First Nations. However, the federal government will not drop its appeal until the agreement is approved.“There’s no evidence that any level of government is taking it seriously,” Mosby said, adding that if reconciliation is to become reality, “Indigenous people have to stop going to the courts” for justice.The TRC’s report is one of many calling for change, Jewell said, and the awareness that it has received gives it life that other reports don’t have. But altogether, there are thousands of recommendations for Canada to improve its relationship with Indigenous people; the 1996 Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal People alone has 440, she noted.Since 2019, researchers at the Yellowhead Institute, an Indigenous-led research centre based out of X University, have been tracking Canada’s progress through annual reports.“The only way to breathe life back into the conversation on reconciliation would be for Canada to first accept the truth that there are too many systems still in place that actively harm Indigenous peoples, particularly the most vulnerable,” the report says.“Accepting this truth exposes any notion of simply ‘repairing’ the relationship between Indigenous peoples and Canadians for what it is: pure fantasy. Real and meaningful transformative change to underlying systems of oppression — not just individual tinkering around the edges of a broken colonial machine — is, therefore, required.”"
"14 sudden death cases of Indigenous people in Thunder Bay, Ont., recommended for police reinvestigation","An investigative team that has been looking into sudden death cases in Thunder Bay, Ont., for years is recommending that police reinvestigate an additional 14, according to a confidential report leaked to CBC News.The cases involve Indigenous people and date back to between 2006 and 2019. The youngest person was two months old and the oldest was 61.The report is part of the final work of the Broken Trust committee, formed after the province's oversight agency, the Office of the Independent Police Review Director, found evidence of systemic racism in the city's police force in 2018.The committee called for the reinvestigation of the sudden deaths of nine Indigenous people. Part of the process was to consider if other sudden death investigations undertaken by the Thunder Bay Police Service should be conducted again.The leaked report, most recently updated in February, begins with a disclaimer that ""due to finite timelines and resources allocated to the process outlined in this report, cases provided here are not an exhaustive list,"" adding there may be other sudden death cases that ""warrant further investigation.""Brian Gray, a spokesperson with Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General, confirmed to CBC News that the ministry has received and is now considering the request to refer 16 sudden deaths for reinvestigation.Those 16 include a coroner's review for a missing person death and for a drug death.In addition, there are 25 unresolved missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG) cases from Thunder Bay — some of which have remained open and have been unresolved for over two decades — that the report recommends be reviewed.Report examines years of investigationsThis is the latest development in a series of complaints and external investigations into the city's police force over the past two months, and it comes as the original Broken Trust process begins to wind down.In 2018, the Office of the Independent Police Review Director issued its Broken Trust report, which found evidence of systemic racism within the force. At the time, the office reviewed 37 sudden death investigations by Thunder Bay police and found nine of them to be ""so problematic"" that they should be re-conducted by a multidisciplinary investigative team.(CBC News Graphics)Those original nine reinvestigations have been criticized by families and their lawyers for lacking transparency, but they have since concluded and the results are now being shared with family members, according to Ontario's chief coroner.The Broken Trust report also recommended the team establish a protocol to determine if other Thunder Bay police sudden death investigations should be redone.CBC News has requested but has not yet received a copy of that protocol from Ontario's chief coroner, who acts as a spokesperson for the executive governance committee overseeing the reinvestigations.But as part of its work, the multidisciplinary investigative team conducted a non-exhaustive review of the police service's and the provincial coroner's records for sudden death and Indigenous death cases between 2000 and 2020. They included 229 cases.The 16 cases recommended to be reinvestigated and reviewed range from what were initially determined to be apparent suicides or deaths ruled ""accidental"" under suspicious circumstances — including due to drownings, repeated falls or hypothermia — drug overdoses, and two shortly after the individual left or was discharged from the Thunder Bay hospital.A CBC News analysis of the case reviews included in the report has identified several similar trends, including:15 of the people who died were Indigenous.In 13 of the cases, there was insufficient investigation of suspects at the death scenes, despite them having violent pasts, including prior involvement in murders and serious assaults.For at least seven of the deaths, the last person to see the deceased alive was an intimate partner.Seven of the cases had investigations explicitly described as ""incomplete"" in the leaked report.In at least six of the cases, Thunder Bay police investigators did not use major case management — a system developed by Ontario in 1997 to establish minimum standards for police investigations of serious incidents.Investigations did not establish a timeline of the individual's whereabouts and actions before their death in at least five cases.One of the key concerns that has emerged over the last decade of public scrutiny of Thunder Bay police and coroners is that they do not adequately communicate with families. That continues to be an issue, with a failure to update family members identified explicitly in three cases reviewed in the report.In January 2017, Thunder Bay police created a sudden death review committee that was required to go over all sudden deaths to ensure all investigative steps were taken. But the leaked report says the police broke that new policy in three of the four sudden death cases reviewed since 2018.CBC News has requested an interview with Thunder Bay police Chief Sylvie Hauth. Her spokesperson had not yet responded at time of this story's publication.Coroner reviews requested to improve public safetyWhile 14 of the cases in the report are recommended for police reinvestigation, the investigative team suggested two sudden deaths be sent to Ontario's coroner for a review or an inquest, to create awareness and recommendations to improve public safety.The first sudden death recommended for coroner re-review involves a vulnerable Indigenous person who went missing from the Thunder Bay hospital and was found dead months later.The report acknowledged Thunder Bay police have updated their missing person policies since 2016.But it added ""this case demonstrates the degree of vulnerability Indigenous peoples with mental health needs can face in Thunder Bay and the need for attention to be brought to missing persons cases of Indigenous peoples of all ages.""The investigative team found considerable issues with the initial police response, including the passing of 20 days before a media release was issued and 30 days before a police ground search occurred.The report presented a similar scenario to a staff sergeant with an Ontario Provincial Police emergency response team to review. That sergeant suggested OPP would have been able to find the person more quickly, the report states.The lack of resources and strategies to properly investigate and curb these occurrences have become a significant threat to public safety. - Investigative team reportThe other is a fatal drug overdose case in 2019. The report said that case is being raised, given the increasing number of drug-related sudden deaths in Thunder Bay and across the province, with Indigenous people at an increased risk in the city.""The lack of resources and strategies to properly investigate and curb these occurrences have become a significant threat to public safety,"" the report added.The case summary included in the report says that when the coroner attended the scene, they immediately indicated it would be a coroner's case and no foul play was suspected, and there ""appeared to be no consideration by police or the coroner about seeking the source of the drugs and determining if Criminal Code charges, such as manslaughter or criminal negligence causing death, may be applicable after some investigation.""But the case review adds there was evidence a woman and two other ""persons of interest"" were present when the victim died.A background check by the investigative team confirmed the suspect was associated with an earlier drug-related homicide and two other overdoses. Yet the suspect wasn't interviewed until two months later, and a number of other leads were never followed up, according to the report.Ontario's chief coroner, Dr. Dirk Huyer, told CBC News in an interview Tuesday that his office was awaiting any direction or recommendations by the provincial attorney general before taking action on the 16 sudden death cases.Huyer previously confirmed to CBC News he would be ordering a new, independent systemic review of the Thunder Bay police death investigation process under the Coroner's Act. That review would take all the materials gathered during the last several years of the Broken Trust process to offer their observations of how the process was conducted, and identify recommendations to create a pathway forward.The chief coroner would not say who was on the Indigenous-led advisory circle guiding that work or who was included on the writing team, but said they include people with a wide range of expertise, including policing, death investigations, human rights and intergenerational trauma.Their work began in February."
COVID-19 in Indigenous communities: What you need to know,"British Columbia announced Thursday that the province would be dropping its mask mandates effective Friday at midnight and a leader in northern B.C. has mixed feelings about the decision.""I do have a bit of concern and I'm wondering if it's too early, but … I'm sure they have their experts looking into that,"" said Dianne Shanoss, executive director of the Gitanmaax Band, near Hazelton, B.C.Shanoss, who is Gitxsan, said the band has close to 800 people living there and currently has active COVID-19 cases.She said the band hasn't had any community lockdowns since April 2021, and they will continue to follow the province's lead when it comes to pandemic related guidelines.She expects to meet with Gitanmaax community health leaders to decide what the next steps are going to be when it comes to pandemic related decisions.Cases continue to trend downwardIndigenous Services Canada (ISC) said that as of Mar. 9, the department is aware of a total of 3,016 hospitalizations in First Nations communities due to COVID-19, and 677 deaths.According to data from ISC, there were 2,690 active cases of COVID-19 reported in First Nations as of Mar. 9. This is down from the 2,975 active cases reported as of Mar. 2. Case numbers may be understated as some provinces limit access to COVID-19 tests.To date, ISC is aware of a total of 12,530 cases in First Nations communities due to the Omicron variant: 7,193 in Eastern Canada and 5,337 in Western Canada. A total of 134 First Nations have reported cases of the strain.The government of Nunavut said as of Mar. 9, there were 472 active cases of COVID-19 in 22 communities.To date, there have been 3,200 confirmed cases in Nunavut, 2,723 total recovered cases and five deaths.

BC Gov News,"The Ministry of Education, in collaboration with the First Nations Education Steering Committee (FNESC), is implementing a new graduation requirement.Expected to take effect in the 2023-24 school year, this requirement will ensure all secondary students complete Indigenous-focused coursework before they graduate from B.C.’s K-12 education system.“We are deeply committed to lasting and meaningful reconciliation in B.C. – guided by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples while working co-operatively with Indigenous Peoples across the province to address the knowledge gaps in our K-12 curriculum,” said Jennifer Whiteside, Minister of Education.” This new requirement will deepen students’ understanding of the experiences, cultures, histories and knowledges of Indigenous Peoples. This will help us to understand the truths of our shared history, while also building knowledge so all students feel a sense of responsibility for our collective future.”Tyrone McNeil, president, FNESC, said: “For many years, FNESC, First Nations and our partners in the public education system have advocated for this important change to the B.C. graduation program. Building awareness and understanding of First Peoples’ perspectives, cultures and histories among all B.C. students will serve as an important step toward reconciliation and an effective strategy to combat racism within the province to the benefit of all British Columbians.”On March 7, the Ministry of Education will launch an online public engagement to gain feedback on the proposed approach to implementing the new graduation requirement, including what related information and resources students, parents and schools may need. The ministry will also consult with Indigenous communities and K-12 partners throughout the spring. FNESC will facilitate information sharing with First Nations. The proposed model would allow students to meet the new requirement through a variety of existing and new course options.Under the proposed model, students who are currently in Grade 10 would be the first group to complete this new requirement, starting in September 2023. The new requirement will apply to all students in B.C. public, independent and offshore schools. B.C. is the first Canadian province/jurisdiction to implement this type of requirement.The new Indigenous-focused course requirement is one of the actions identified in B.C.’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act Draft Action Plan, as part of a broader Indigenous-specific anti-racism and discrimination strategy for the K-12 system, on which First Nations were consulted in 2021.Quotes:Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association –“To support meaningful truth and reconciliation, it is critical that B.C. students graduate with an understanding of the ancient history of the lands their schools are situated upon. B.C.’s curriculum offers many Indigenous-focused courses with rich content and boards of education have created unique courses that give students the chance to strengthen ties to Indigenous communities. This change to the graduation requirement will help further deepen and expand this necessary work.”Teri Mooring, president, BC Teachers’ Federation (BCTF) –“The introduction of a First Peoples course requirement is an incredibly important milestone on our shared journey of truth and reconciliation, and something the BCTF has advocated strongly for over many years. It will be important that this policy change be supported by a focused effort to recruit more Indigenous teachers to ensure truths can be taught from a place of lived experience wherever possible throughout B.C.'s public education system.”Quick Facts:The Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Call to Action #62 includes a call to make age-appropriate curriculum on residential schools, Treaties and Aboriginal peoples’ historical and contemporary contributions to Canada a mandatory education requirement for kindergarten to Grade 12 students.In November 2019, B.C. became the first jurisdiction in Canada to formally adopt the internationally recognized standards of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples through legislation with the passing of the B.C. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act.B.C.’s redesigned K-12 curriculum was fully implemented in 2019, and explores Indigenous worldviews, perspectives, cultures and histories across multiple grade levels and a range of subject areas.While more than 90% of B.C. students graduate with more than the required number of credits (80) for a B.C.

"2020 census undercounted Black, Latino, Indigenous populations","WASHINGTON — The 2020 census undercounted Black, Latino and Indigenous populations while over-counting white and Asian people, according to estimates from a report the U.S. Census Bureau released Thursday.The findings continue a long-standing struggle for the bureau with counting underrepresented groups while over-counting non-Hispanic white people. Many of them live in hard-to-reach areas, such as rural communities and areas with limited access to the internet.The data released Thursday was the result of two internal analyses that collected data through a sample survey of demographic records. The findings suggested the 2020 census missed Hispanics and Latinos at more than three times the rate in 2010 (an undercount rate of roughly 5 percent, as opposed to 1.5 percent in 2010).The Black population was undercounted at a rate of 3.3 percent, up from 2.1 percent in 2010. Indigenous people living on reservations were undercounted at a rate of 5.6 percent, higher than the 2010 rate of 4.9 percent. Indigenous people not living on reservations were not miscounted.Due to the pandemic, in-person door-knocking operations were suspended in March 2020 and only restarted in the late summer. Inaccurate or improperly processed data means many vulnerable groups could still be left out, altering the resources these communities receive and the power they wield.In 2020, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to stop gathering census information early. The bureau argued it wanted to stop the count so it could start processing the data to meet a Dec. 31 deadline, set in federal law, for reporting the results to the president and the states.Data from the sample survey also suggested the non-Hispanic white population and the Asian population were over-counted, and the difference in over-counting between 2010 and 2020 was statistically significant.The data crunched by the bureau illustrates the racial makeup of America and helps determine the distribution of federal aid and how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets, among other things."

The goal is to remedy inequalities experienced by historically marginalized groups and increase the representation of diverse researchers among holders of Canada Research Chairs. In 2021, Université Laval gave out 27 CRCs, with only 11 attributed in competitions for people in under-represented groups. The university hires about 1,600 people each year, and the hiring of under-represented groups through the federal program represents 0.1 per cent of those hired, Stewart said. “We can therefore say that generally, employment offers at Université Laval don’t exclude anyone.” More On This Topic National Assembly work disrupted as COVID-19 sidelines MNAs 23,000 Quebec government workers hold first strike dayShare this article in your social networkLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Montreal Gazette Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Montreal Gazette, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Marvel is changing a comic book character after Indigenous people criticized it for being demeaning,"(CNN) Marvel is changing the name and design of a character that debuted in a recent issue of the comic miniseries ""King Conan"" after it was criticized for its portrayal of an Indigenous woman.The third issue of "" King Conan ,"" published on February 16, finds its protagonist stranded on a island with a scantily clad princess named Matoaka. The princess, as it turns out, has a dark past: She hails from ""a land far to the west,"" and once fell in love with a man who tried to colonize her people. When the man ransacked her home, she killed him, but her father nonetheless exiled her to the island, where she's now cursed to lure other would-be colonizers away from her native land.To people in Indian Country, Matoaka's name and backstory were a clear reference to the real-life Pocahontas , who privately went by the same name.For centuries, Pocahantas has been romanticized and mythologized as a woman who defied her father to save the English colonist John Smith from execution. In reality, she was around 11 or 12 when she first met Smith, and historians have disputed Smith's claims that she rescued him at all. Later, she was kidnapped by the English and raped in captivity, according to the Mattaponi tribe's oral historyGiven that history, some Indigenous comic book artists and fans found the character in ""King Conan"" -- and the hypersexualized way she was depicted -- to be demeaning and disrespectful.""The real Matoaka was a pre-teen girl who suffered at the hands of her English captors,"" Arigon Starr, a comic book artist who is an enrolled member of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma, wrote in an email to CNN. ""What's even more shocking is that most of this information is online; a quick search would have informed the writer, artist, editor and publisher that it was a poor choice to give this character the name of a famous victim of violence.""Kayla Shaggy, a Two-Spirit comic book artist who is Diné and Anishinabe, said she felt that the character reduced Indigenous women to an offensive stereotype.""The fact that they depict an Indigenous woman as this nubile prize to be won by non-natives in stereotypical, fetish-y clothing contributes to the current, ongoing harm and ignorance of missing and murdered Indigenous women,"" she wrote to CNN.In light of the criticism, writer Jason Aaron apologized for the character, calling his decision to use the name Matoaka ""ill-considered.""""This new character is a supernatural, thousand-year-old princess of a cursed island within a world of pastiche and dark fantasy and was never intended to be based on anyone from history,"" he said in a statement shared by Marvel. ""I should have better understood the name's true meaning and resonance and recognized it wasn't appropriate to use it. I understand the outrage expressed by those who hold the true Matoaka's legacy dear, and for all of this and the distress it's caused, I apologize.""Aaron added that he had donated the money he made from the issue to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. A spokesperson for Marvel said that Matoaka's name and appearance would be changed in future printings, upcoming issues and digital editions, though the details were still being finalized.Still, Shaggy was disappointed that the company didn't pull the issue from stands and halt distribution altogether.""The character is still an Indigenous stereotype, her story is a rehash of racist narratives, and overall continuing the story still puts money in the company's pocket at the expense of native people,"" she said.Native Americans have long been marginalized and misrepresented in comic books, ""from the bloodthirsty barbarians and noble savages of dime novels, to formulaic secondary characters and sidekicks"" as Michael Sheyahshe explored in his book ""Native Americans in Comic Books: A Critical Study.""""To paraphrase from Michael's work -- Native people have been relegated to the sidekick, shaman, overly sexualized or super tracker characters,"" Starr said. ""We are rarely the main character or the hero.""In recent years, however, projects helmed by Native artists and writers have provided more authentic representation in the comic book world. Starr and Shaggy said they hoped the ""King Conan"" controversy would result in more opportunities for Indigenous creators in the industry.""The support for authentic Native characters and comics is out there,"" Starr added. ""Maybe one day, Marvel and DC will catch up to us."""
"A Proclamation on Indigenous Peoples' Day, 2021","Since time immemorial, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians have built vibrant and diverse cultures — safeguarding land, language, spirit, knowledge, and tradition across the generations. On Indigenous Peoples’ Day, our Nation celebrates the invaluable contributions and resilience of Indigenous peoples, recognizes their inherent sovereignty, and commits to honoring the Federal Government’s trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations.Our country was conceived on a promise of equality and opportunity for all people — a promise that, despite the extraordinary progress we have made through the years, we have never fully lived up to. That is especially true when it comes to upholding the rights and dignity of the Indigenous people who were here long before colonization of the Americas began. For generations, Federal policies systematically sought to assimilate and displace Native people and eradicate Native cultures. Today, we recognize Indigenous peoples’ resilience and strength as well as the immeasurable positive impact that they have made on every aspect of American society. We also recommit to supporting a new, brighter future of promise and equity for Tribal Nations — a future grounded in Tribal sovereignty and respect for the human rights of Indigenous people in the Americas and around the world.In the first week of my Administration, I issued a memorandum reaffirming our Nation’s solemn trust and treaty obligations to American Indian and Alaska Native Tribal Nations and directed the heads of executive departments and agencies to engage in regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal officials. It is a priority of my Administration to make respect for Tribal sovereignty and self-governance the cornerstone of Federal Indian policy. History demonstrates that Native American people — and our Nation as a whole — are best served when Tribal governments are empowered to lead their communities and when Federal officials listen to and work together with Tribal leaders when formulating Federal policy that affects Tribal Nations.The contributions that Indigenous peoples have made throughout history — in public service, entrepreneurship, scholarship, the arts, and countless other fields — are integral to our Nation, our culture, and our society. Indigenous peoples have served, and continue to serve, in the United States Armed Forces with distinction and honor — at one of the highest rates of any group — defending our security every day. And Native Americans have been on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, working essential jobs and carrying us through our gravest moments. Further, in recognition that the pandemic has harmed Indigenous peoples at an alarming and disproportionate rate, Native communities have led the way in connecting people with vaccination, boasting some of the highest rates of any racial or ethnic group.The Federal Government has a solemn obligation to lift up and invest in the future of Indigenous people and empower Tribal Nations to govern their own communities and make their own decisions. We must never forget the centuries-long campaign of violence, displacement, assimilation, and terror wrought upon Native communities and Tribal Nations throughout our country. Today, we acknowledge the significant sacrifices made by Native peoples to this country — and recognize their many ongoing contributions to our Nation.On Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we honor America’s first inhabitants and the Tribal Nations that continue to thrive today. I encourage everyone to celebrate and recognize the many Indigenous communities and cultures that make up our great country.NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2021, as Indigenous Peoples’ Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in honor of our diverse history and the Indigenous peoples who contribute to shaping this Nation.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR."
Guest Article: Indigenous Peoples Must be Central to Tackling the Climate Crisis,"By David Kaimowitz, Senior Forestry Officer, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and Manager, Forest and Farm FacilityAs leaders from around the globe gather for the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26), it is vital that they recognize two important facts. The first is that we cannot reach climate goals without protecting and sustainably managing the carbon-absorbing forests that cover a third of the Earth’s land surface.The second is that we cannot protect forests without Indigenous Peoples. We know that forests do better when indigenous land rights are respected, with lower deforestation rates and carbon emissions. Currently, Indigenous Peoples and local communities manage at least 24% of the total above-ground carbon stored in the world’s tropical forests. Without them, we cannot win the race to save the planet.The good news is that there has been a recent sea-change towards recognition of the role that Indigenous Peoples must play for a healthier planet and the achievement of many of the SDGs, including Goal 13 (climate action) and Goal 15 (life on land). The deeply intertwined and rapidly worsening climate and biodiversity crises have started to convince major philanthropists of the need to take action and put Indigenous Peoples and local communities in the driving seat.Last month, nine grantmakers from prestigious foundations pledged USD 5 billion for conservation efforts that address threats to biodiversity and help curb climate change, and they committed to taking a new approach: working with Indigenous and local communities. One of the grantmakers, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, suggested that past conservation efforts had failed precisely because they did not include local and Indigenous Peoples. Bezos said the nine foundations, his Bezos Earth Fund among them, would not “make the same mistakes,” and would support a new generation of programmes led by local communities.We have also seen some positive moves by governments to recognize the central role of Indigenous Peoples for climate mitigation and nature conservation. It was announced last month that the World Heritage-listed Daintree tropical rainforest in northern Australia will officially be returned to its traditional owners, the Eastern Kuku Yalanji people, who will manage the area in partnership with regional government.Canada has pledged CAD 340 million over the next five years to support Indigenous-led stewardship as part of its commitment to conserving 30% of the country’s lands and waters by 2030. In the US, land is being returned to Native American tribes to manage for conservation.And the United Kingdom government – the host of COP 26 – has been vocal on the need for Indigenous rights. Zac Goldsmith, the UK’s Minister for Pacific and the Environment, said last month that while others have been “profoundly part of the problem,” Indigenous Peoples have been providing the solutions without “any meaningful support or even recognition.”At the same time, Indigenous Peoples have increasingly received international recognition and been present at the table for major global events. This year saw the launch of the first major report by a UN agency that recognizes and rigorously documents that Indigenous Peoples are the best guardians of our forests. Among the report’s findings is the fact that, due to reduced deforestation rates, territories owned collectively by Indigenous Peoples have avoided up to 59.7 million metric tons (MtC) of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions each year across Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia – the equivalent of taking up to 12.6 million vehicles out of circulation for one year.At the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) World Conservation Congress in September 2021, an umbrella group representing more than two million Indigenous Peoples across nine South American nations succeeded in having a resolution passed to protect 80% of the Amazon by 2025. Finally, the UN-backed Science Panel for the Amazon, comprising 200 experts and researchers from the region, has highlighted Indigenous rights as central for the protection of the Amazon.But there is work yet to be done. Next week’s UN Climate Change Conference must recognize and support the more than 476 million Indigenous Peoples living in 90 countries and the vital role they play in protecting our natural resources and helping us to reach climate goals.Governments must step up to the plate by committing funding to Indigenous Peoples’ territorial rights and forest management, especially in tropical countries. Multilateral trust funds, such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), must also increase their attention to, and funding for, Indigenous Peoples.We need to strengthen the role that Indigenous and tribal Peoples play in forest governance and bolster communal territorial rights. We need to compensate Indigenous and tribal communities for the environmental services they provide. And we need to facilitate community forest management. Only then will we unlock the true potential of Indigenous Peoples to guide the planet towards a greener future."
"Indigenous people are heading to CoP26: “There is no solution to the climate crisis, without us”","The Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (Apib), together with all its grassroots organisations, mobilised the largest delegation of Brazilian indigenous leaders in the history of the Climate Conference (CoP26) to discuss solutions to the climate crisis.More than 40 representatives of the indigenous peoples will be in Glasgow, Scotland, between October 31 and November 12 with the proposal to occupy the Conference and alert the world about the need to demarcate the indigenous lands and protect the indigenous peoples for the future of the planet.An excerpt from Apib’s message to world leaders, businessmen and civil society organisations attending CoP26, says:“We stand against false solutions based on technological innovations designed from the same developmental and productivist logic that causes climate change. We criticise solutions that do not recognise indigenous peoples and local communities as central to the defence of forests, the reduction of deforestation and fires and as essential to ensure that we reach the stated goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.”The Brazilian indigenous delegation at the conference will denounce the ongoing indigenous genocide and ecocide that is underway in Brazil, aggravated by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the Federal Government’s death project.On the international day of indigenous peoples, August 9, Apib filed an unprecedented denouncement at the International Criminal Court to denounce the Bolsonaro government for genocide.The delegation says in its message:“We have shaped and protected our biomes at the price of millions of our relatives. The genocide of the original people, the persecution of the defenders of territories and the illegal capture of our lands, is the largest and most widespread crime that humanity has produced throughout its history. This is a continuous and present crime, which we denounce in all the instances that we occupy.”According to the delegation’s organisation, this is the largest delegation of Brazilian indigenous leaders in the history of the CoP. Apib has participated in the conference since 2014 and had mobilised, in 2019, a group of 18 people for the last CoP, which was until then the largest participation of leaders in the meeting.In this context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected billions of people, indigenous people reinforce the need to respect the biodiversity present in indigenous territories.For the indigenous delegation, the current policy of the Federal Government is harmful to the environment, the climate and traditional communities.Apib and its indigenous organisations have constantly denounced the invasions of territories, the contamination of rivers and springs by pesticides and mercury, the rampant deforestation of the Amazon forest, the Cerrado and the Pantanal wetlands.According to the organisation, despite this scenario, economic funds continue to financially support the unbridled greed that destroys the planet.Even though they are responsible for protecting the largest part of the global forest heritage and, consequently, the capacity to store more than 293 gigatonnes of carbon, a third of indigenous and community lands in 64 countries are under threat due to the lack of land tenure rights.Brazil, which originally was all indigenous land, today reserves only 13.8 per cent of the national territory for its original people. And this portion of the territory has been the most preserved during the past 35 years, representing less than one per cent of deforestation in Brazil in the period, according to data from Mapbiomas.This percentage does not mean the full extent of forests protected by indigenous peoples and, according to Apib, in addition to the halt in the demarcation of indigenous lands, traditional territories already demarcated are under strong legislative threat, in an unconstitutional attempt to deny the traditional presence of indigenous peoples in the country and the occupation of their lands long before the formation of the Brazilian state.The delegation says:“We are going to Glasgow to once again alert the world and on this occasion with even more gravity: humanity is leading the destiny of all of us to chaos and death! Our Mother Earth is exhausted. The future of the planet and the species that inhabit it depend on our global capacity for cooperation to defend and strengthen indigenous peoples and local communities, to guarantee the security of traditional territories in the face of predatory economic interests and to create and promote effective climate solutions based on nature and the communities that protect it.”This piece was first published on Pressenza.

Indigenous people get less than 1% of climate funding? It’s actually worse (commentary),"The lead author of a Rainforest Foundation Norway report showing how little funding goes to Indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) for tenure and forest management writes that the reality is even worse than the “less than 1%” soundbite often shared.Over 10 years, $2.7 billion was given to support IPLCs’ tenure rights and forest management, which equals 0.74% of total development aid allocated to address climate change.Researchers further discovered that 17% of the funding to IPLC tenure and management went to projects that specifically included an IPLC organization, thus representing 0.13% of aid designated to climate change.This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay.Indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) received an unprecedented level of attention, recognition and support at this year’s United Nations climate summit, known as COP26. This was the result of many years of consistent and strategic campaigning by IPLC groups and their allies, in combination with growing scientific evidence that shows how their custodianship of land and forests is an indispensable solution to climate change.In just about any panel or session I attended at COP26, one would hear the same soundbite: “Indigenous peoples receive less than 1% of climate finance.”This is not wrong, but as one of the policy advisers responsible for digging up this number, I feel like I have a responsibility to point of that the reality is actually far worse. It is well below 1%.The number comes from a report Rainforest Foundation Norway (RFN) published in April this year, with the help of two relentless number crunchers at Indufor North America, Jeffrey Hatcher and Michael Owen. This report maps the international funding that went to support IPLC tenure rights and forest management, from bilateral, multilateral and philanthropic donors. The figure we found was $2.7 billion over the last 10 years.When we compared this to all climate aid (counted as official development aid, or ODA) over the same period, we found that this was less than 1% — hence the soundbite. Actually, the figure is 0.74% of climate ODA. This figure was rounded up to account for uncertainties on both sides of the equation.In the report, RFN chose the precise, but not so campaign-friendly, formulation: “[Support for] IPLC tenure and forest management amounted to less than the equivalent one percent of ODA for climate.”The reason for choosing this complicated wording was due to the fact that funding for IPLC tenure and forest management comes from several of the donors’ thematic priorities: climate change, biodiversity, agriculture, livelihoods, human rights, etc.As such, the comparison with climate finance was to indicate its scale, or lack thereof. The 0.74% figure is in fact not a share of climate finance, but how the total IPLC tenure and forest management funding compared to the total scale of climate ODA. Climate finance is likely to dominate but not make up all of the funding for IPLC tenure and forest management. And ODA only makes up a part of what is usually counted as climate finance toward the $100 billion target.Funding in the hands of intermediariesFurther, the $2.7 billion delivered over 10 years is not a figure that actually went to IPLCs and their organizations, as one might think from hearing the soundbite. It includes funding for government institutions or other implementing organizations to implement tenure reforms or programs that improve forest monitoring, land use management, and livelihoods in and around Indigenous forests, etc.All of this can, and hopefully will, have a positive impact on IPLC’s rights and ability to live in and off their traditional forests, but it is not funding to IPLC organizations.Further, we found that most of the funding goes to or through multilateral institutions or large international organizations. The research was done by searching through publicly available databases on aid disbursements for relevant disbursements. These databases represent a major improvement on aid transparency, but unfortunately don’t yet allow us to track funding disbursements all the way to IPLC organizations.The current funding architecture of IPLC support largely relies on one or several other organizations or institutions to act as intermediaries between the donor and the IPLC organizations — organizations such as RFN. And in the databases, only the first recipient in this chain of granting and regranting is reported, so it’s impossible to assess how much ends up in the hands of IPLC organizations.However, researchers at Indufor searched the descriptions of the projects that made up the $270 million per year figure to look for specific mentions of IPLC organizations from across the tropics. They found that only about 17% of the funding went to projects that mentioned an IPLC organization.This constitutes no more than $46 million per year. Or, in other words, 0.13% when compared to all climate development aid. This is an indication of how much, or should we say how little, of the total funding reaches these organizations.When we say “indication,” it rests on two caveats. First, not all of this funding is likely to reach IPLC organizations, as the intermediaries involved also have overhead costs. Second, we cannot rule out that IPLC organizations may receive funding through projects that don’t specify the name of the organization in their project description. However, it’s unlikely that much of this funding will be passed on to IPLC organizations, beyond the identified 17%.This assumption is strengthened due to the fact that most of the funding we identified went to either large international organizations or to multilateral institutions, such as the World Bank, the regional development banks, or the U.N. Anecdotal evidence shows that not much of the funding that goes through these institutions ends up in the hands of the IPLC organizations.Any successful campaign depends on having a clear, catchy message that is easy to repeat and remember, for both the campaigners and their targets. “Indigenous peoples receive less than 1% of climate finance” became such a successful message before and during COP26 — with potentially major impact on how funding for tropical forests protection is spent.However, as our research shows, the reality of the matter is even worse. This makes the demand of the Indigenous leaders for more and more direct funding, which was reflected in the $1.7 billion IPLC forest tenure pledge at COP26, even more important and urgent. Now, with the research we’ve done, we have the tools needed to monitor whether this pledge materializes.Torbjørn Gjefsen is a climate policy adviser at Rainforest Foundation Norway (RFN). He has led RFN’s work on the “Falling Short” report that helped build the case for more funding for IPLCs as part of the climate and nature protection and restoration agendas.Banner image: The Waorani community protesting and campaigning for other indigenous Amazon communities.

Indigenous People To Get $1.7 Billion For Their Role As 'Forest Guardians',"Leaders of more than 100 nations, including Brazil, China and the United States, vowed on Monday, November 2, at climate talks in Glasgow to end deforestation by 2030. Brazil, where stretches of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down, was among the signatories. The countries who have signed the pledge, including Canada, Brazil, Russia, China, Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the UK and the US, cover around 85 per cent of the world's forests.📢 NEWS: At COP26, over 100 leaders have committed to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030.""To have any chance of keeping below 1.5°C of global warming, we must halt deforestation"" -- Sir David AttenboroughLearn more:👉 https://t.co/KEQU6kbnaS#COP26 pic.twitter.com/uTSR63qw7L — COP26 (@COP26) November 2, 2021As part of this goal, at least USD 1.7bn of funding will be given directly to indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) in recognition of their key role in protecting the planet's lands and forests, reported The Guardian. The governments of the US, Germany, Norway, Netherlands and UK are leading the funding pledge. Over 30 financial firms, including Aviva, Schroders and Axa, also pledged to stop investing in companies responsible for deforestation.'Another Decade of Deforestation'The pledge will demand ""transformative further action,"" the countries' declaration said, and it was accompanied by several measures intended to help put it into effect. But some advocacy groups criticised it and said they would allow deforestation to continue. Greenpeace criticised it for giving the green light to ""another decade of deforestation.""""Indigenous peoples are calling for 80 per cent of the Amazon to be protected by 2025, and they're right, that's what's needed,"" said Greenpeace Brazil executive director Carolina Pasquali. ""The climate and the natural world can't afford this deal,"" she added.Tuntiak Katan, a leader of Ecuador's indigenous Shuar people who serves as general coordinator of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities, said, ""We are happy with the financing announcement, but we will be watching for concrete measures that will reveal whether the intent is to transform a system that has directed less than 1 per cent of climate funding to indigenous and local communities. What matters is what happens next.""Earlier efforts to conserve forests have largely been unsuccessful. One programme recognised in the Paris climate accord seeks to pay forested nations for reducing tree loss, but not much progress has been achieved on that front.In 2014, an agreement to end deforestation by 2030, the New York Declaration on Forests, set goals without a means to achieve them, and deforestation continued (Brazil did not sign up for it). Last year, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil hit a 12-year high under President Jair Bolsonaro.Is This Pledge Different?However, supporters of the new pledge said that it expands the number of countries and comes with specific guidelines to save forests. ""What we're doing here is trying to change the economics on the ground to make forests worth more alive than dead,"" The New York Times quoted Eron Bloomgarden, whose group Emergent helps match public and private investors with forested countries and provinces looking to receive payments for reducing deforestation, as saying.The participating governments promised ""support for smallholders, Indigenous Peoples and local communities, who depend on forests for their livelihoods and have a key role in their stewardship.""Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which collectively accounts for 85 per cent of the world's forests, are among those backing the joint statement to be released at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow.Apart from absorbing carbon dioxide, forests filter water, cool the air and even make rain, supporting agriculture elsewhere.Also Read: Over 2.2 Million Indian Accounts Banned On WhatsApp In September: Report"

BC Gov News,"The Ministry of Education, in collaboration with the First Nations Education Steering Committee (FNESC), is implementing a new graduation requirement.Expected to take effect in the 2023-24 school year, this requirement will ensure all secondary students complete Indigenous-focused coursework before they graduate from B.C.’s K-12 education system.“We are deeply committed to lasting and meaningful reconciliation in B.C. – guided by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples while working co-operatively with Indigenous Peoples across the province to address the knowledge gaps in our K-12 curriculum,” said Jennifer Whiteside, Minister of Education.” This new requirement will deepen students’ understanding of the experiences, cultures, histories and knowledges of Indigenous Peoples. This will help us to understand the truths of our shared history, while also building knowledge so all students feel a sense of responsibility for our collective future.”Tyrone McNeil, president, FNESC, said: “For many years, FNESC, First Nations and our partners in the public education system have advocated for this important change to the B.C. graduation program. Building awareness and understanding of First Peoples’ perspectives, cultures and histories among all B.C. students will serve as an important step toward reconciliation and an effective strategy to combat racism within the province to the benefit of all British Columbians.”On March 7, the Ministry of Education will launch an online public engagement to gain feedback on the proposed approach to implementing the new graduation requirement, including what related information and resources students, parents and schools may need. The ministry will also consult with Indigenous communities and K-12 partners throughout the spring. FNESC will facilitate information sharing with First Nations. The proposed model would allow students to meet the new requirement through a variety of existing and new course options.Under the proposed model, students who are currently in Grade 10 would be the first group to complete this new requirement, starting in September 2023. The new requirement will apply to all students in B.C. public, independent and offshore schools. B.C. is the first Canadian province/jurisdiction to implement this type of requirement.The new Indigenous-focused course requirement is one of the actions identified in B.C.’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act Draft Action Plan, as part of a broader Indigenous-specific anti-racism and discrimination strategy for the K-12 system, on which First Nations were consulted in 2021.Quotes:Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association –“To support meaningful truth and reconciliation, it is critical that B.C. students graduate with an understanding of the ancient history of the lands their schools are situated upon. B.C.’s curriculum offers many Indigenous-focused courses with rich content and boards of education have created unique courses that give students the chance to strengthen ties to Indigenous communities. This change to the graduation requirement will help further deepen and expand this necessary work.”Teri Mooring, president, BC Teachers’ Federation (BCTF) –“The introduction of a First Peoples course requirement is an incredibly important milestone on our shared journey of truth and reconciliation, and something the BCTF has advocated strongly for over many years. It will be important that this policy change be supported by a focused effort to recruit more Indigenous teachers to ensure truths can be taught from a place of lived experience wherever possible throughout B.C.'s public education system.”Quick Facts:The Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Call to Action #62 includes a call to make age-appropriate curriculum on residential schools, Treaties and Aboriginal peoples’ historical and contemporary contributions to Canada a mandatory education requirement for kindergarten to Grade 12 students.In November 2019, B.C. became the first jurisdiction in Canada to formally adopt the internationally recognized standards of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples through legislation with the passing of the B.C. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act.B.C.’s redesigned K-12 curriculum was fully implemented in 2019, and explores Indigenous worldviews, perspectives, cultures and histories across multiple grade levels and a range of subject areas.While more than 90% of B.C. students graduate with more than the required number of credits (80) for a B.C.

"2020 census undercounted Black, Latino, Indigenous populations","WASHINGTON — The 2020 census undercounted Black, Latino and Indigenous populations while over-counting white and Asian people, according to estimates from a report the U.S. Census Bureau released Thursday.The findings continue a long-standing struggle for the bureau with counting underrepresented groups while over-counting non-Hispanic white people. Many of them live in hard-to-reach areas, such as rural communities and areas with limited access to the internet.The data released Thursday was the result of two internal analyses that collected data through a sample survey of demographic records. The findings suggested the 2020 census missed Hispanics and Latinos at more than three times the rate in 2010 (an undercount rate of roughly 5 percent, as opposed to 1.5 percent in 2010).The Black population was undercounted at a rate of 3.3 percent, up from 2.1 percent in 2010. Indigenous people living on reservations were undercounted at a rate of 5.6 percent, higher than the 2010 rate of 4.9 percent. Indigenous people not living on reservations were not miscounted.Due to the pandemic, in-person door-knocking operations were suspended in March 2020 and only restarted in the late summer. Inaccurate or improperly processed data means many vulnerable groups could still be left out, altering the resources these communities receive and the power they wield.In 2020, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to stop gathering census information early. The bureau argued it wanted to stop the count so it could start processing the data to meet a Dec. 31 deadline, set in federal law, for reporting the results to the president and the states.Data from the sample survey also suggested the non-Hispanic white population and the Asian population were over-counted, and the difference in over-counting between 2010 and 2020 was statistically significant.The data crunched by the bureau illustrates the racial makeup of America and helps determine the distribution of federal aid and how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets, among other things."

The goal is to remedy inequalities experienced by historically marginalized groups and increase the representation of diverse researchers among holders of Canada Research Chairs. In 2021, Université Laval gave out 27 CRCs, with only 11 attributed in competitions for people in under-represented groups. The university hires about 1,600 people each year, and the hiring of under-represented groups through the federal program represents 0.1 per cent of those hired, Stewart said. “We can therefore say that generally, employment offers at Université Laval don’t exclude anyone.” More On This Topic National Assembly work disrupted as COVID-19 sidelines MNAs 23,000 Quebec government workers hold first strike dayShare this article in your social networkLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Montreal Gazette Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Montreal Gazette, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Marvel is changing a comic book character after Indigenous people criticized it for being demeaning,"(CNN) Marvel is changing the name and design of a character that debuted in a recent issue of the comic miniseries ""King Conan"" after it was criticized for its portrayal of an Indigenous woman.The third issue of "" King Conan ,"" published on February 16, finds its protagonist stranded on a island with a scantily clad princess named Matoaka. The princess, as it turns out, has a dark past: She hails from ""a land far to the west,"" and once fell in love with a man who tried to colonize her people. When the man ransacked her home, she killed him, but her father nonetheless exiled her to the island, where she's now cursed to lure other would-be colonizers away from her native land.To people in Indian Country, Matoaka's name and backstory were a clear reference to the real-life Pocahontas , who privately went by the same name.For centuries, Pocahantas has been romanticized and mythologized as a woman who defied her father to save the English colonist John Smith from execution. In reality, she was around 11 or 12 when she first met Smith, and historians have disputed Smith's claims that she rescued him at all. Later, she was kidnapped by the English and raped in captivity, according to the Mattaponi tribe's oral historyGiven that history, some Indigenous comic book artists and fans found the character in ""King Conan"" -- and the hypersexualized way she was depicted -- to be demeaning and disrespectful.""The real Matoaka was a pre-teen girl who suffered at the hands of her English captors,"" Arigon Starr, a comic book artist who is an enrolled member of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma, wrote in an email to CNN. ""What's even more shocking is that most of this information is online; a quick search would have informed the writer, artist, editor and publisher that it was a poor choice to give this character the name of a famous victim of violence.""Kayla Shaggy, a Two-Spirit comic book artist who is Diné and Anishinabe, said she felt that the character reduced Indigenous women to an offensive stereotype.""The fact that they depict an Indigenous woman as this nubile prize to be won by non-natives in stereotypical, fetish-y clothing contributes to the current, ongoing harm and ignorance of missing and murdered Indigenous women,"" she wrote to CNN.In light of the criticism, writer Jason Aaron apologized for the character, calling his decision to use the name Matoaka ""ill-considered.""""This new character is a supernatural, thousand-year-old princess of a cursed island within a world of pastiche and dark fantasy and was never intended to be based on anyone from history,"" he said in a statement shared by Marvel. ""I should have better understood the name's true meaning and resonance and recognized it wasn't appropriate to use it. I understand the outrage expressed by those who hold the true Matoaka's legacy dear, and for all of this and the distress it's caused, I apologize.""Aaron added that he had donated the money he made from the issue to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. A spokesperson for Marvel said that Matoaka's name and appearance would be changed in future printings, upcoming issues and digital editions, though the details were still being finalized.Still, Shaggy was disappointed that the company didn't pull the issue from stands and halt distribution altogether.""The character is still an Indigenous stereotype, her story is a rehash of racist narratives, and overall continuing the story still puts money in the company's pocket at the expense of native people,"" she said.Native Americans have long been marginalized and misrepresented in comic books, ""from the bloodthirsty barbarians and noble savages of dime novels, to formulaic secondary characters and sidekicks"" as Michael Sheyahshe explored in his book ""Native Americans in Comic Books: A Critical Study.""""To paraphrase from Michael's work -- Native people have been relegated to the sidekick, shaman, overly sexualized or super tracker characters,"" Starr said. ""We are rarely the main character or the hero.""In recent years, however, projects helmed by Native artists and writers have provided more authentic representation in the comic book world. Starr and Shaggy said they hoped the ""King Conan"" controversy would result in more opportunities for Indigenous creators in the industry.""The support for authentic Native characters and comics is out there,"" Starr added. ""Maybe one day, Marvel and DC will catch up to us."""
"A Proclamation on Indigenous Peoples' Day, 2021","Since time immemorial, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians have built vibrant and diverse cultures — safeguarding land, language, spirit, knowledge, and tradition across the generations. On Indigenous Peoples’ Day, our Nation celebrates the invaluable contributions and resilience of Indigenous peoples, recognizes their inherent sovereignty, and commits to honoring the Federal Government’s trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations.Our country was conceived on a promise of equality and opportunity for all people — a promise that, despite the extraordinary progress we have made through the years, we have never fully lived up to. That is especially true when it comes to upholding the rights and dignity of the Indigenous people who were here long before colonization of the Americas began. For generations, Federal policies systematically sought to assimilate and displace Native people and eradicate Native cultures. Today, we recognize Indigenous peoples’ resilience and strength as well as the immeasurable positive impact that they have made on every aspect of American society. We also recommit to supporting a new, brighter future of promise and equity for Tribal Nations — a future grounded in Tribal sovereignty and respect for the human rights of Indigenous people in the Americas and around the world.In the first week of my Administration, I issued a memorandum reaffirming our Nation’s solemn trust and treaty obligations to American Indian and Alaska Native Tribal Nations and directed the heads of executive departments and agencies to engage in regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal officials. It is a priority of my Administration to make respect for Tribal sovereignty and self-governance the cornerstone of Federal Indian policy. History demonstrates that Native American people — and our Nation as a whole — are best served when Tribal governments are empowered to lead their communities and when Federal officials listen to and work together with Tribal leaders when formulating Federal policy that affects Tribal Nations.The contributions that Indigenous peoples have made throughout history — in public service, entrepreneurship, scholarship, the arts, and countless other fields — are integral to our Nation, our culture, and our society. Indigenous peoples have served, and continue to serve, in the United States Armed Forces with distinction and honor — at one of the highest rates of any group — defending our security every day. And Native Americans have been on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, working essential jobs and carrying us through our gravest moments. Further, in recognition that the pandemic has harmed Indigenous peoples at an alarming and disproportionate rate, Native communities have led the way in connecting people with vaccination, boasting some of the highest rates of any racial or ethnic group.The Federal Government has a solemn obligation to lift up and invest in the future of Indigenous people and empower Tribal Nations to govern their own communities and make their own decisions. We must never forget the centuries-long campaign of violence, displacement, assimilation, and terror wrought upon Native communities and Tribal Nations throughout our country. Today, we acknowledge the significant sacrifices made by Native peoples to this country — and recognize their many ongoing contributions to our Nation.On Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we honor America’s first inhabitants and the Tribal Nations that continue to thrive today. I encourage everyone to celebrate and recognize the many Indigenous communities and cultures that make up our great country.NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2021, as Indigenous Peoples’ Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in honor of our diverse history and the Indigenous peoples who contribute to shaping this Nation.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR."
Guest Article: Indigenous Peoples Must be Central to Tackling the Climate Crisis,"By David Kaimowitz, Senior Forestry Officer, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and Manager, Forest and Farm FacilityAs leaders from around the globe gather for the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26), it is vital that they recognize two important facts. The first is that we cannot reach climate goals without protecting and sustainably managing the carbon-absorbing forests that cover a third of the Earth’s land surface.The second is that we cannot protect forests without Indigenous Peoples. We know that forests do better when indigenous land rights are respected, with lower deforestation rates and carbon emissions. Currently, Indigenous Peoples and local communities manage at least 24% of the total above-ground carbon stored in the world’s tropical forests. Without them, we cannot win the race to save the planet.The good news is that there has been a recent sea-change towards recognition of the role that Indigenous Peoples must play for a healthier planet and the achievement of many of the SDGs, including Goal 13 (climate action) and Goal 15 (life on land). The deeply intertwined and rapidly worsening climate and biodiversity crises have started to convince major philanthropists of the need to take action and put Indigenous Peoples and local communities in the driving seat.Last month, nine grantmakers from prestigious foundations pledged USD 5 billion for conservation efforts that address threats to biodiversity and help curb climate change, and they committed to taking a new approach: working with Indigenous and local communities. One of the grantmakers, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, suggested that past conservation efforts had failed precisely because they did not include local and Indigenous Peoples. Bezos said the nine foundations, his Bezos Earth Fund among them, would not “make the same mistakes,” and would support a new generation of programmes led by local communities.We have also seen some positive moves by governments to recognize the central role of Indigenous Peoples for climate mitigation and nature conservation. It was announced last month that the World Heritage-listed Daintree tropical rainforest in northern Australia will officially be returned to its traditional owners, the Eastern Kuku Yalanji people, who will manage the area in partnership with regional government.Canada has pledged CAD 340 million over the next five years to support Indigenous-led stewardship as part of its commitment to conserving 30% of the country’s lands and waters by 2030. In the US, land is being returned to Native American tribes to manage for conservation.And the United Kingdom government – the host of COP 26 – has been vocal on the need for Indigenous rights. Zac Goldsmith, the UK’s Minister for Pacific and the Environment, said last month that while others have been “profoundly part of the problem,” Indigenous Peoples have been providing the solutions without “any meaningful support or even recognition.”At the same time, Indigenous Peoples have increasingly received international recognition and been present at the table for major global events. This year saw the launch of the first major report by a UN agency that recognizes and rigorously documents that Indigenous Peoples are the best guardians of our forests. Among the report’s findings is the fact that, due to reduced deforestation rates, territories owned collectively by Indigenous Peoples have avoided up to 59.7 million metric tons (MtC) of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions each year across Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia – the equivalent of taking up to 12.6 million vehicles out of circulation for one year.At the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) World Conservation Congress in September 2021, an umbrella group representing more than two million Indigenous Peoples across nine South American nations succeeded in having a resolution passed to protect 80% of the Amazon by 2025. Finally, the UN-backed Science Panel for the Amazon, comprising 200 experts and researchers from the region, has highlighted Indigenous rights as central for the protection of the Amazon.But there is work yet to be done. Next week’s UN Climate Change Conference must recognize and support the more than 476 million Indigenous Peoples living in 90 countries and the vital role they play in protecting our natural resources and helping us to reach climate goals.Governments must step up to the plate by committing funding to Indigenous Peoples’ territorial rights and forest management, especially in tropical countries. Multilateral trust funds, such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), must also increase their attention to, and funding for, Indigenous Peoples.We need to strengthen the role that Indigenous and tribal Peoples play in forest governance and bolster communal territorial rights. We need to compensate Indigenous and tribal communities for the environmental services they provide. And we need to facilitate community forest management. Only then will we unlock the true potential of Indigenous Peoples to guide the planet towards a greener future."
"Indigenous people are heading to CoP26: “There is no solution to the climate crisis, without us”","The Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (Apib), together with all its grassroots organisations, mobilised the largest delegation of Brazilian indigenous leaders in the history of the Climate Conference (CoP26) to discuss solutions to the climate crisis.More than 40 representatives of the indigenous peoples will be in Glasgow, Scotland, between October 31 and November 12 with the proposal to occupy the Conference and alert the world about the need to demarcate the indigenous lands and protect the indigenous peoples for the future of the planet.An excerpt from Apib’s message to world leaders, businessmen and civil society organisations attending CoP26, says:“We stand against false solutions based on technological innovations designed from the same developmental and productivist logic that causes climate change. We criticise solutions that do not recognise indigenous peoples and local communities as central to the defence of forests, the reduction of deforestation and fires and as essential to ensure that we reach the stated goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.”The Brazilian indigenous delegation at the conference will denounce the ongoing indigenous genocide and ecocide that is underway in Brazil, aggravated by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the Federal Government’s death project.On the international day of indigenous peoples, August 9, Apib filed an unprecedented denouncement at the International Criminal Court to denounce the Bolsonaro government for genocide.The delegation says in its message:“We have shaped and protected our biomes at the price of millions of our relatives. The genocide of the original people, the persecution of the defenders of territories and the illegal capture of our lands, is the largest and most widespread crime that humanity has produced throughout its history. This is a continuous and present crime, which we denounce in all the instances that we occupy.”According to the delegation’s organisation, this is the largest delegation of Brazilian indigenous leaders in the history of the CoP. Apib has participated in the conference since 2014 and had mobilised, in 2019, a group of 18 people for the last CoP, which was until then the largest participation of leaders in the meeting.In this context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected billions of people, indigenous people reinforce the need to respect the biodiversity present in indigenous territories.For the indigenous delegation, the current policy of the Federal Government is harmful to the environment, the climate and traditional communities.Apib and its indigenous organisations have constantly denounced the invasions of territories, the contamination of rivers and springs by pesticides and mercury, the rampant deforestation of the Amazon forest, the Cerrado and the Pantanal wetlands.According to the organisation, despite this scenario, economic funds continue to financially support the unbridled greed that destroys the planet.Even though they are responsible for protecting the largest part of the global forest heritage and, consequently, the capacity to store more than 293 gigatonnes of carbon, a third of indigenous and community lands in 64 countries are under threat due to the lack of land tenure rights.Brazil, which originally was all indigenous land, today reserves only 13.8 per cent of the national territory for its original people. And this portion of the territory has been the most preserved during the past 35 years, representing less than one per cent of deforestation in Brazil in the period, according to data from Mapbiomas.This percentage does not mean the full extent of forests protected by indigenous peoples and, according to Apib, in addition to the halt in the demarcation of indigenous lands, traditional territories already demarcated are under strong legislative threat, in an unconstitutional attempt to deny the traditional presence of indigenous peoples in the country and the occupation of their lands long before the formation of the Brazilian state.The delegation says:“We are going to Glasgow to once again alert the world and on this occasion with even more gravity: humanity is leading the destiny of all of us to chaos and death! Our Mother Earth is exhausted. The future of the planet and the species that inhabit it depend on our global capacity for cooperation to defend and strengthen indigenous peoples and local communities, to guarantee the security of traditional territories in the face of predatory economic interests and to create and promote effective climate solutions based on nature and the communities that protect it.”This piece was first published on Pressenza.

Indigenous people get less than 1% of climate funding? It’s actually worse (commentary),"The lead author of a Rainforest Foundation Norway report showing how little funding goes to Indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) for tenure and forest management writes that the reality is even worse than the “less than 1%” soundbite often shared.Over 10 years, $2.7 billion was given to support IPLCs’ tenure rights and forest management, which equals 0.74% of total development aid allocated to address climate change.Researchers further discovered that 17% of the funding to IPLC tenure and management went to projects that specifically included an IPLC organization, thus representing 0.13% of aid designated to climate change.This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay.Indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) received an unprecedented level of attention, recognition and support at this year’s United Nations climate summit, known as COP26. This was the result of many years of consistent and strategic campaigning by IPLC groups and their allies, in combination with growing scientific evidence that shows how their custodianship of land and forests is an indispensable solution to climate change.In just about any panel or session I attended at COP26, one would hear the same soundbite: “Indigenous peoples receive less than 1% of climate finance.”This is not wrong, but as one of the policy advisers responsible for digging up this number, I feel like I have a responsibility to point of that the reality is actually far worse. It is well below 1%.The number comes from a report Rainforest Foundation Norway (RFN) published in April this year, with the help of two relentless number crunchers at Indufor North America, Jeffrey Hatcher and Michael Owen. This report maps the international funding that went to support IPLC tenure rights and forest management, from bilateral, multilateral and philanthropic donors. The figure we found was $2.7 billion over the last 10 years.When we compared this to all climate aid (counted as official development aid, or ODA) over the same period, we found that this was less than 1% — hence the soundbite. Actually, the figure is 0.74% of climate ODA. This figure was rounded up to account for uncertainties on both sides of the equation.In the report, RFN chose the precise, but not so campaign-friendly, formulation: “[Support for] IPLC tenure and forest management amounted to less than the equivalent one percent of ODA for climate.”The reason for choosing this complicated wording was due to the fact that funding for IPLC tenure and forest management comes from several of the donors’ thematic priorities: climate change, biodiversity, agriculture, livelihoods, human rights, etc.As such, the comparison with climate finance was to indicate its scale, or lack thereof. The 0.74% figure is in fact not a share of climate finance, but how the total IPLC tenure and forest management funding compared to the total scale of climate ODA. Climate finance is likely to dominate but not make up all of the funding for IPLC tenure and forest management. And ODA only makes up a part of what is usually counted as climate finance toward the $100 billion target.Funding in the hands of intermediariesFurther, the $2.7 billion delivered over 10 years is not a figure that actually went to IPLCs and their organizations, as one might think from hearing the soundbite. It includes funding for government institutions or other implementing organizations to implement tenure reforms or programs that improve forest monitoring, land use management, and livelihoods in and around Indigenous forests, etc.All of this can, and hopefully will, have a positive impact on IPLC’s rights and ability to live in and off their traditional forests, but it is not funding to IPLC organizations.Further, we found that most of the funding goes to or through multilateral institutions or large international organizations. The research was done by searching through publicly available databases on aid disbursements for relevant disbursements. These databases represent a major improvement on aid transparency, but unfortunately don’t yet allow us to track funding disbursements all the way to IPLC organizations.The current funding architecture of IPLC support largely relies on one or several other organizations or institutions to act as intermediaries between the donor and the IPLC organizations — organizations such as RFN. And in the databases, only the first recipient in this chain of granting and regranting is reported, so it’s impossible to assess how much ends up in the hands of IPLC organizations.However, researchers at Indufor searched the descriptions of the projects that made up the $270 million per year figure to look for specific mentions of IPLC organizations from across the tropics. They found that only about 17% of the funding went to projects that mentioned an IPLC organization.This constitutes no more than $46 million per year. Or, in other words, 0.13% when compared to all climate development aid. This is an indication of how much, or should we say how little, of the total funding reaches these organizations.When we say “indication,” it rests on two caveats. First, not all of this funding is likely to reach IPLC organizations, as the intermediaries involved also have overhead costs. Second, we cannot rule out that IPLC organizations may receive funding through projects that don’t specify the name of the organization in their project description. However, it’s unlikely that much of this funding will be passed on to IPLC organizations, beyond the identified 17%.This assumption is strengthened due to the fact that most of the funding we identified went to either large international organizations or to multilateral institutions, such as the World Bank, the regional development banks, or the U.N. Anecdotal evidence shows that not much of the funding that goes through these institutions ends up in the hands of the IPLC organizations.Any successful campaign depends on having a clear, catchy message that is easy to repeat and remember, for both the campaigners and their targets. “Indigenous peoples receive less than 1% of climate finance” became such a successful message before and during COP26 — with potentially major impact on how funding for tropical forests protection is spent.However, as our research shows, the reality of the matter is even worse. This makes the demand of the Indigenous leaders for more and more direct funding, which was reflected in the $1.7 billion IPLC forest tenure pledge at COP26, even more important and urgent. Now, with the research we’ve done, we have the tools needed to monitor whether this pledge materializes.Torbjørn Gjefsen is a climate policy adviser at Rainforest Foundation Norway (RFN). He has led RFN’s work on the “Falling Short” report that helped build the case for more funding for IPLCs as part of the climate and nature protection and restoration agendas.Banner image: The Waorani community protesting and campaigning for other indigenous Amazon communities.

Indigenous People To Get $1.7 Billion For Their Role As 'Forest Guardians',"Leaders of more than 100 nations, including Brazil, China and the United States, vowed on Monday, November 2, at climate talks in Glasgow to end deforestation by 2030. Brazil, where stretches of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down, was among the signatories. The countries who have signed the pledge, including Canada, Brazil, Russia, China, Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the UK and the US, cover around 85 per cent of the world's forests.📢 NEWS: At COP26, over 100 leaders have committed to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030.""To have any chance of keeping below 1.5°C of global warming, we must halt deforestation"" -- Sir David AttenboroughLearn more:👉 https://t.co/KEQU6kbnaS#COP26 pic.twitter.com/uTSR63qw7L — COP26 (@COP26) November 2, 2021As part of this goal, at least USD 1.7bn of funding will be given directly to indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) in recognition of their key role in protecting the planet's lands and forests, reported The Guardian. The governments of the US, Germany, Norway, Netherlands and UK are leading the funding pledge. Over 30 financial firms, including Aviva, Schroders and Axa, also pledged to stop investing in companies responsible for deforestation.'Another Decade of Deforestation'The pledge will demand ""transformative further action,"" the countries' declaration said, and it was accompanied by several measures intended to help put it into effect. But some advocacy groups criticised it and said they would allow deforestation to continue. Greenpeace criticised it for giving the green light to ""another decade of deforestation.""""Indigenous peoples are calling for 80 per cent of the Amazon to be protected by 2025, and they're right, that's what's needed,"" said Greenpeace Brazil executive director Carolina Pasquali. ""The climate and the natural world can't afford this deal,"" she added.Tuntiak Katan, a leader of Ecuador's indigenous Shuar people who serves as general coordinator of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities, said, ""We are happy with the financing announcement, but we will be watching for concrete measures that will reveal whether the intent is to transform a system that has directed less than 1 per cent of climate funding to indigenous and local communities. What matters is what happens next.""Earlier efforts to conserve forests have largely been unsuccessful. One programme recognised in the Paris climate accord seeks to pay forested nations for reducing tree loss, but not much progress has been achieved on that front.In 2014, an agreement to end deforestation by 2030, the New York Declaration on Forests, set goals without a means to achieve them, and deforestation continued (Brazil did not sign up for it). Last year, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil hit a 12-year high under President Jair Bolsonaro.Is This Pledge Different?However, supporters of the new pledge said that it expands the number of countries and comes with specific guidelines to save forests. ""What we're doing here is trying to change the economics on the ground to make forests worth more alive than dead,"" The New York Times quoted Eron Bloomgarden, whose group Emergent helps match public and private investors with forested countries and provinces looking to receive payments for reducing deforestation, as saying.The participating governments promised ""support for smallholders, Indigenous Peoples and local communities, who depend on forests for their livelihoods and have a key role in their stewardship.""Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which collectively accounts for 85 per cent of the world's forests, are among those backing the joint statement to be released at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow.Apart from absorbing carbon dioxide, forests filter water, cool the air and even make rain, supporting agriculture elsewhere.Also Read: Over 2.2 Million Indian Accounts Banned On WhatsApp In September: Report"
Indigenous peoples in Guatemala demand sovereignty over oil and mining resources,"The case could set an international precedent for indigenous people to control resources on their land, which they say is critical to climate actionBy Chloé FarandA Mayan community in Guatemala is taking the government to court in a case that could recognise the right of indigenous peoples to control oil, gas and mining resources on their land.The Q’eqchi’ community of Agua Caliente is demanding the Inter-American Court of Human Rights voids the permits of an open-pit nickel mine, in the town of El Estor, for which it says it was never consulted.Under international human rights standards, states have the obligation to consult indigenous communities and obtain their free, prior and informed consent over projects affecting their lands and resources.But indigenous communities in Latin America have denounced constant violations of this right.The case is one of a growing number of lawsuits brought by indigenous peoples to compel governments in the region to respect their right to veto extractive projects affecting them.Lawyers in this suit, which opened last week, are going a step further. They argue that the court should recognise the rights of indigenous people to permanent sovereignty over their natural resources as a principle of public international law.“We believe consultation is not enough, consent is not enough. But the court has never said anything about the rights of communities to their natural resources,” Leonardo Crippa, an attorney with the Indian Law Resource Center representing the community, told Climate Home News.If successful, the lawyers argue it could set a “historical” legal precedent for other communities in Latin America and become “fundamental” to advance climate action in the region.The case comes amid a growing recognition of indigenous peoples’ critical role in addressing the dual climate and biodiversity crisis.Indigenous people are estimated to protect 80% of global biodiversity. In recent years, a ballooning body of studies has shown that indigenous territories have lower or similar levels of deforestation to other protected areas.At the Cop26 climate talks, governments recognised “the important role” of indigenous peoples “in addressing and responding to climate change” and agreed “to respect, promote and consider” their rights.Rodrigo Tot is an indigenous leader in Guatemala’s Agua Caliente, who was awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize for his efforts to protect his community against mining. He told Climate Home he hoped the case will bring peace to his community, which has lived in fear of intimidation and violence for opposing the mine.“When it comes to protecting forests, it will not be up to the government who has failed, but to us — this is what we have been fighting for, for the right to continue to protect our lands,” he said.For Crippa, guaranteeing indigenous people’s sovereignty will further “alleviate extreme poverty” and help meet sustainable development goals by allowing communities to reap the benefits of projects they have agree to.The case comes hot on the heels of a ruling by the Constitutional Court in Ecuador, the country’s most powerful judiciary body, which called for stronger protection to guarantee the right of indigenous communities to consent to any oil and mining activities affecting their land.Legal observers say it gives Ecuador one of the most powerful legal precedents in the world on the rights of indigenous peoples right to consent.They say this deals a blow to Ecuador’s president Guillermo Lasso’s ambition to double the country’s oil production to one millions barrels per day and expand mining activities. Indigenous land covers 70% of the oil and mineral-rich Ecuadorian Amazon.The court ruled that if an indigenous community refuses a project, the government can still move forward in “exceptional cases” but that “under no circumstances can a project be carried out that generates excessive sacrifices to the collective rights of communities and nature”.The indigenous rights movement in Ecuador maintains that any oil or project in their ancestral territories taking place against their will implies unreasonable sacrifices, according to NGO Amazon Frontlines.Last month, a ruptured oil pipeline contaminated water that supplies indigenous communities in a protected area of the Amazon’s rainforest.“This ruling is monumental. It’s a game-changer in the balance of power between the extractive interests that the state represents and indigenous peoples,” said Brian Parker, of Amazon Frontlines.Kevin Currey is programme officer at the Ford Foundation, a member of the alliance of governments and private funders that committed to provide $1.7bn to support indigenous advance their land rights by 2025 during the Cop26 talks.The alliance has committed to fund activities that strengthen and protect indigenous peoples’ land resources rights and “strategic litigation may be one important avenue for securing and defending their rights,” he said.“These recent cases should be a wake-up call, not just in Ecuador and Guatemala, but around the world that ignoring indigenous rights generates enormous reputational, financial, and legal risks.”Lawyers in the Guatemala case hope the court decision will push international financiers and investors not to support projects where indigenous peoples’ rights have been violated.A 2018 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that conflict with local communities was costing large-scale mining projects $20 million per week in delayed production."
Indigenous peoples’ lives matter,"Despite being the custodians of 80 percent of the world’s biodiversity and holders of a cocktail of unique traditions, cultures, knowledge systems and languages, the over 476 million indigenous people globally have faced systemic discrimination, violation of their rights, plunder of their natural resources and invasion of their territories.From The Aborigines in Australia, Mayas in Guatemala, Maasais in Kenya and the Tuareg in Mali, indigenous peoples remain among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, and their life’s expectancy is 20 years lower than that of their non-indigenous counterparts. Although constituting about 5 percent of the world’s population, they make up 15 percent of its extreme poverty.Yet, even with such adversities they have played a pivotal role in understanding and mitigating the devastating impacts of modern day calamities like climate change, providing valuable lessons on how to address food scarcity and protecting the planet. Modern science has borrowed heavily from them.As we mark the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples, the international community should coalesce around the philosophy of championing for a more equitable and sustainable world that embraces inclusive participation, respect for the rights of vulnerable minorities and equal opportunities for all.To protect the world’s heritage, diversity of languages and natural resources that are increasingly under threat from urbanisation and the climate crisis, we need to prioritise the needs and aspirations of the indigenous people, listen to their concerns, respect their way of life and protect them as envisioned in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.Image: Ken kahiri.. republish this article"
US: Indigenous People's Day Embarked With Celebrations And Protests,"Indigenous people across the United States marked Monday with celebrations of their heritage, education campaigns and a push for the Biden administration to make good on its word.The federal holiday created decades ago to recognise Christopher Columbus' sighting in 1492 of what came to be known as the Americas increasingly has been rebranded as Indigenous Peoples Day.For Michaela Pavlat, cultural interpreter at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, the day is one of celebration, reflection and recognition that Indigenous communities are fighting for land rights, for the U.S. government to uphold treaties, and for visibility and understanding.“As long as you're on Native land and stolen land, it's Indigenous Peoples Day,” said Pavlat, who is Sault Ste. Marie Band of Chippewa Indians (Anishinaabe). “We have a lot of movement and a lot of issues we're facing in our communities, and you can have that conversation every day.”EVENTS THIS YEARMore than a dozen protesters linked arms and sat along the White House fence line Monday to call on the Biden administration to do more to combat climate change and ban fossil fuels. Others cheered and chanted in support from across the street as police blocked off the area with yellow tape and arrested the seated protesters.The Andrew Jackson statue at the center of Lafayette Park was defaced with the words “Expect Us” — part of a rallying cry used by Indigenous people who have been fighting against fossil fuel pipelines. Jackson, a slave-owning president, forced Cherokees and many other Native Americans on deadly marches out of their southern homelands.“Indigenous people have been on the front lines of protecting the land, the people, and it's time for the government and these huge systems to do more,” said Angel Charley, of Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico, who was among the protesters.Indigenous groups also planned protests in Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico.At the Boston Marathon, race organizers honored 1936 and '39 winner Ellison “Tarzan” Brown and three-time runner-up Patti Catalano Dillon, a member of the Mi'kmaq tribe. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a member of Laguna Pueblo, said she ran for missing and slain Indigenous people and their families, the victims of the boarding school era and the ""promise that our voices are being heard and will have a part in an equitable and just future in this new era.""Others gathered for prayers, dances and other commemorations in cities across the U.S.On social media, people posted educational resources that included maps of Indigenous land, ways to support Indigenous communities, and recommendations for television shows and films that prominently feature Indigenous people, like “Reservation Dogs.”WHAT'S NEW?President Joe Biden last week issued the first presidential proclamation of Indigenous Peoples Day, the most significant boost yet to efforts to refocus Columbus Day in recognition of the Italian explorer's brutal treatment of people who already occupied what came to be known as the Americas.About 20 states observe Indigenous Peoples Day by law, through proclamation or other action, along with cities and universities across the country.Oregon recognized Indigenous Peoples Day on Monday, months after its Legislature overwhelmingly approved a bill in support of the change from Columbus Day.In Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers joined the leaders from tribes in the state and issued a formal apology for Wisconsin's role in Native American boarding schools era.NOT JUST A CELEBRATIONThe Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian on Monday hosted a virtual conversation about mixed Black and Indigenous identity and how the struggles of one side sometimes get overshadowed by the other.Joy SpearChief-Morris pointed to the Civil Rights movement and the Red Power movement, which included the Native American occupation of Alcatraz Island off the coast of San Francisco more than 50 years ago.“Both groups supported each other, but we don't really talk about the Red Power movement,” said SpearChief-Morris, who is African American and Kainai Nation (Blood Tribe) from Canada.The panelists noted that Afro-Indigenous identity goes back generations.“Everything that we do is to bring about Black liberation and Indigenous sovereignty on this land and to dismantle white supremacy and settler colonialism,” said Amber Starks, who is African American and a citizen of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. “And I'd like to add racial capitalism”Kyle Mays, an assistant professor at the University of California-Los Angeles who is Black and Saginaw Anishinaabe, acknowledged the work isn't easy.While Indigenous Peoples Day is “cool,"" he said, “I don't want a day for celebration. I want justice."""
"In Canada, Indigenous communities and scientists collaborate on marine research","The Apoqnmatulti’k project combines Indigenous knowledge, Western science and local knowledge holders to gather information about three important marine species in two ecosystems in Nova Scotia, Canada.The project comes at a time of increased urgency over management of marine species, as many fish stocks are on the decline, while access to lucrative fisheries has sparked conflict.Project partners say the project’s collaborative approach will provide information that could help direct stewardship and conservation of species that are important to many communities.As important as that new data is, project participants say the greatest insight of the project may be that forging the trusting relationships required for collaborative research takes time, which doesn’t always correspond to standard academic deadlines.COLCHESTER COUNTY, Canada — Standing on the snow-covered banks of the Shubenacadie River in Canada’s eastern province, Nova Scotia, Alanna Sylbiloy tosses a wire trap into the icy water flowing past, in search of a small fish known as a tomcod.Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod) — or punamu in the language of the Mi’kmaq, the Indigenous people of the region — are an unassuming fish. They’re an indifferent swimmer, 15 centimeters (6 inches) long at most, and sometimes white, appropriate for a species also called “frostfish” because they travel upriver to spawn in January. They’re also sometimes the same mottled brown as the blocks of ice Syliboy points to on the banks of the river that ebbs and flows to the rhythm of the world’s highest tides in the nearby Bay of Fundy.But the species is significant in one way, Syliboy tells Mongabay. “This fish is a historical fish for our people. It kept us alive for thousands of years; they are the staple fish and they come right up to our river.”After half an hour, Syliboy braces herself against the bank and begins hauling the trap out of the water. If there are fish inside, she’ll perform a quick surgery to implant a tag, which will allow the fish to be tracked with acoustic receivers placed throughout this watershed. This will allow her to better assess the tomcod’s movements and spawning habitats.It’s part of a project called Apoqnmatulti’k that combines Indigenous and Western knowledge, as well as insights from local fishers, to better understand the movements of lobster, eel and tomcod in two important ecosystems. The project is moving into the final year of its original three-year timeline. In the case of the tomcod, Syliboy says Indigenous community members wanted to know whether they were spawning in the river and if they remained there all year. Traditional knowledge can provide answers to some of these questions, says Syliboy, who is also the community liaison with the Apoqnmatulti’k project.“But we need change, to use science to back that up. So they’re complementing and strengthening each other,” she says.In working this way, the project has forged what participants describe as a new process of bringing together worldviews that haven’t always been in sync. The idea is that this could in turn inform decisions about how to manage marine species for the benefit of ecosystems and the communities who depend on them.“I hope that it will help everyone understand that at the end of the day, we all live here, and we all depend on each other and this world,” Syliboy says. “If this project can teach anybody anything, it’s that even despite the differences of knowledge and understanding, you can still work together for the same benefit.”A sense of urgency for collaboration and researchThe state of marine species is an important consideration in Nova Scotia, where many Indigenous and coastal communities depend on fisheries. American lobster, for instance, forms the basis of the region’s most lucrative fishery, which brings in nearly C$700 million ($550 million) a year. Other fisheries, though smaller, also play an important role in the economic and cultural life of coastal communities.But historically, decisions about these species haven’t always incorporated local and Indigenous knowledge. Moreover, the question of who is able to benefit from the use of these species has at times been a point of conflict.In 2020, when a Mi’kmaq community launched a livelihood lobster fishery outside of the commercial season — a fishery to which a 1999 Supreme Court of Canada decision affirmed Indigenous communities have a right — it sparked resistance, at times violent, from non-native commercial fishers, who identified concerns with conservation of the stock.Mi’kmaq communities have brought a number of court cases against provincial and federal governments for interfering in their self-regulated lobster fishery, on the grounds that such interference violates treaty rights. On the other hand, an association representing stakeholders in the commercial fishery has since been granted intervenor status to participate in the lawsuits, with the goal of keeping regulation of Indigenous fisheries on par with that of commercial fisheries. The association cited a desire to ensure the conservation and sustainability of the fishing industry for future generations. Meanwhile, stocks of other important fish species in the region have dropped to critical levels in recent years, prompting frustration among Indigenous communities and commercial fishers alike.All of this has contributed to an increased sense of urgency for research that could inform better stewardship of species, and which all communities can trust. The Apoqnmatulti’k project has been working to build some of that trust, by bringing together Western scientists, Indigenous communities and local knowledge holders to monitor the movements and habitats of significant species in two parts of the province.In the Bay of Fundy, which includes the tidal Shubenacadie River, the project is also tracking the movements of the American eel (Anguilla rostrata), a threatened species. In the saltwater Bras d’Or Lake of Unama’ki/Cape Breton, the northernmost part of Nova Scotia, the project is studying eels and American lobsters (Homarus americanus).Sara Iverson, a professor of biology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and scientific director of the Ocean Tracking Network, says the project was designed to bring together different ways of knowing, including the Ocean Tracking Network’s expertise in electronic tagging and acoustic monitoring.But from its inception, Iverson says, the project has also sought to involve Indigenous communities and local fishers in a collaborative principle that’s reflected in the project’s name.“We asked the [Mi’kmaq] Elder Albert Marshall to help us come up with a name,” Iverson tells Mongabay. “And it’s Apoqnmatulti’k, which means ‘we help each other’ in Mi’kmaq. So it’s been very interesting, in terms of coming together and trying to create a really open dialog.”Incorporating Indigenous two-eyed seeingFor Shelley Denny, the foundational nature of the partnership is key. Denny is the director of aquatic research and stewardship for the Unama’ki Institute of Natural Resources, an organization that represents the five Mi’kmaq communities of Unama’ki on natural resources issues. The organization is also a partner in the project, which uses the collaborative approach to science known as two-eyed seeing, a term also coined by Albert Marshall. Two-eyed seeing is a framework for combining Indigenous and Western knowledge systems to better understand the natural world.“It’s more than just the knowledge itself — it’s how we acquire that knowledge,” Denny says. “Two-eyed seeing starts with the whole project: it’s in the research questions, it’s how we interact, it’s how we collect samples.”Two-eyed seeing, or etuaptmumk, is an influential concept that has been adopted into the policies of institutions across Canada. Along with other philosophies that advocate for a similar approach, it’s also helped fuel a wave of interest in partnering with Indigenous groups on research projects.But for that partnership to avoid being seen as simply “verifying” Mi’kmaq knowledge using Western science, or applying Indigenous knowledge in a token way, Indigenous partners need to be involved in the decision-making process of the project, Denny says. In the case of the Apoqnmatulti’k project, communities were involved in questions such as the selection the study species.“We’re always very aware of the power of Western knowledge over Mi’kmaq knowledge and that’s something we struggle with,” Denny says. “So, in this situation, we see that our knowledge is being used to support further scientific inquiry into certain areas — it’s not about proving it, but we want to have another way of looking at it as well.”In the case of one of the study species, eel, the project is combining traditional knowledge of eel habitat with acoustic tracking to shed light on questions such as the location of the eel’s overwintering grounds, for which there are gaps in current Western scientific knowledge. Eel is an important source of food and medicine for Mi’kmaq communities.Ultimately, this collaborative approach could be used to advance the communities’ goals, Denny says. This includes identifying eel habitat in areas that are vulnerable to development and would benefit from increased protection.But according to Denny, as important as that knowledge could be, one of the most significant insights gleaned from this project is in what it’s shown about how knowledge systems long perceived as contradictory can work together.“This isn’t just about tracking lobster and eel,” she says, “this is about a partnership between two very different ways of thinking.”Building relationships is just as importantDarren Porter, a commercial fisherman who has also partnered in the project from the beginning, says ensuring that commercial fishers also have a seat at the table is a way of strengthening relationships that have been challenged in recent years: between fishers and scientists, as well as between fishers and Indigenous communities.“You can’t just leave out the one group and expect them to buy into this,” he says. “If they’re out together, gathering this information together, [and] building relationships, then whoever’s doing that can take that information back to their respective camps, and say, ‘listen, this is what we’ve seen, this is what’s going on.’“There’s no ulterior motive. It’s just science — pure knowledge. And you can’t argue with it if you’re all involved in it. So, this [collaboration] is the answer to almost all conflicts in the ecosystem.”At times, Porter says, his role has entailed tapping other project partners on the shoulder to remind them not to forget about the role of local fishers.This is especially important given that local knowledge holders and Indigenous communities often have the same goal, Porter says: preserving and protecting the environment.“I’m on the water, and Mi’kmaq knowledge holders are on the water, and we see what’s going on in real time,” Porter says. “When we communicate, we can help keep the academics on point to what’s important in some cases. And they can [also] help us keep things on point.”The researchers involved in the project say they’ve learned something too, including that combining Indigenous and Western forms of knowledge into a new knowledge system takes time.“The process of doing the work is just as important as the results that you get, and I think that doesn’t necessarily fit with normal academic timetables,” says Iverson from Dalhousie University.“That’s where I think we’ve learned the most: that a three-year project is simply not enough time to get the normal scientific results that granting agencies and university programs would expect — and making that clear, that the process of building these relationships is just as important as the scientific output.”Back on the banks of the Shubenacadie, Alanna Syliboy says she’s brought that principle of relationship building into her own work. She’s learned how to tag fish while working on the project.In turn, she’s had to advocate at times for more respectful treatment of the study species, including changing tagging practices so that team members stop and make an offering when a fish is accidentally killed during the tagging process, or requesting that if eels have to be killed deliberately, it be done in a way that aligns with Mi’kmaq ethics.Speaking up about those concerns was intimidating, Syliboy says, but she reminded herself of the name of the project, and its meaning of mutual aid.“You know, they’re helping us learn the science. But we also have to help them understand the Mi’kmaq worldview — and building those relationships, and foundations, takes time.”Ultimately there’s a lot at stake in this collaboration, both for the ecosystem and for communities. Even though the tomcod helped sustain Mi’kmaq people for thousands of years, by providing a reliable source of food at a time when little else was available, Syliboy didn’t grow up eating it herself. Her mother and grandparents are survivors of Canada’s residential school system, which caused widespread culture and traditional knowledge loss among Indigenous people in the country.‘It’s time to reclaim that knowledge,” she says. “That’s what my job and this project allow me to do, because we are working for our communities and our people.”Eventually, she says she hopes to teach her own children to harvest tomcod, something that the project has already helped by filling in some of the gaps in research.But in the meantime, after hauling in empty traps, Syliboy gives up tagging at the site. It’s a typical outcome in an unusually difficult year for tagging; a traditional knowledge holder who advises the team on tomcod says he’s never seen a winter like this one. It’s a reminder of the unpredictable shifts that are on the way due to climate change, and the role of collaborative research in helping all communities prepare for the challenges still to come.Banner image: Team members prepare to deploy an acoustic receiver in the Bras D’or Lake.

‘A continuation of colonialism’: indigenous activists say their voices are missing at Cop26,"As world leaders inside the Cop26 conference centre in Glasgow boasted about pledges to slash greenhouse gas emissions and end deforestation, indigenous delegates gathered across the river Clyde to commemorate activists killed for trying to protect the planet from corporate greed and government inaction.At least 1,005 environmental and land rights defenders have been murdered since the Paris accords were signed six years ago, according to the international non-profit Global Witness. One in three of those killed were indigenous people.The dead include Berta Cáceres, winner of the prestigious Goldman prize for environmental defenders, who was shot dead at her home in Honduras in March 2016 for opposing the construction of an internationally financed dam on a river considered sacred by her Lenca people.As the names of the murdered defenders were projected on a large outdoor screen, indigenous activists from Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador and the Philippines implored political leaders to listen to their struggles.“The Cop is a big business, a continuation of colonialism where people come not to listen to us, but to make money from our land and natural resources,” said Ita Mendoza, 46, an indigenous land defender from the Mixteca region of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, attending Cop for the first time. “What benefits does the Cop bring when more than a thousand people fighting to keep the planet alive have been killed [since Paris]?”Mendoza is part of the Futuros Indígenas (Indigenous Futures) collective from Mexico, who spent months crowdfunding to be able to attend Cop26 so their communities’ struggles and vision for protecting the planet might be heard.The collective did not get accreditation for the full two weeks, and as Cop first-timers are struggling to navigate the bureaucracy and structural barriers to their participation.A visual projection memorialising murdered land defenders. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianStill, at least they made it. About two-thirds of civil society organizations who usually attend Cop could not come to Glasgow due to a combination of visa and accreditation problems, lack of access to Covid-19 vaccines and changing travel rules. Mostly absent are those from the global south – poorer, less industrialized countries who have contributed least to greenhouse gas emissions but are disproportionately harmed by increasingly intense extreme weather events linked to global heating such as drought, storms and floods.Their voices will be missed during the negotiations, but the problems run much deeper, according to multiple veteran Cop participants.In the 26 years since the first Cop was held in Berlin in 1995, international climate policies have mostly ignored or violated the cultural and territorial rights of indigenous peoples – despite them being recognized in 2001 as a formal constituency, one of nine broad thematic clusters (that also include business groups, environmental NGOs, women and youth groups and trade unions) permitted to observe and lobby negotiators.Indigenous people are more visible but we’re not taken any more seriously; we’re romanticized and tokenized Eriel DerangerThen in 2015, the Paris accords legally recognized the crucial role of traditional knowledge and innovations by local communities and indigenous peoples in understanding and tackling the climate crisis. The move was meant to ensure they could participate and influence international climate policies in a more meaningful and equal way.But six years on, indigenous people interviewed by the Guardian say little has changed inside the UN-led negotiations, while outside environmental destruction continues unchecked in their communities and the impact of the climate crisis is getting worse.05:33 Indigenous activists on tackling the climate crisis: 'We have done more than any government' – video“Indigenous people are more visible but we’re not taken any more seriously; we’re romanticized and tokenized,” said Eriel Deranger, executive director of Indigenous Climate Action and member of the facilitated working group for North America, part of the new UN structures established after Paris.“They’re trying to collect and preserve indigenous knowledge while continuing to leave us out of the actual decision-making and positions of power. It’s the only lever we have to hold states and governments accountable, but it’s the same paternalistic system as ever. We’re set up to fail, so that’s where civil society must come in.”Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the North American Indigenous Environmental Network, who has attended every Cop since 1998, said indigenous knowledge holders were being “co-opted and manipulated by the Eurocentric UN system”.Activists in Glasgow. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThis week, it was announced that $1.7bn will be given to indigenous peoples and local communities in recognition of their key role in protecting the planet’s lands and forests.Net-zero targets, the central theme of Cop26, revolve around incentivizing carbon capture markets through mass reforestation, biofuels and new technologies – which many indigenous leaders see as false climate solutions that will lead to further land grabs and environmental and cultural destruction. For them, keeping fossil fuels and minerals in the ground is the only way to curtail global heating and its devastating impacts.Chief Ninawa Inu Huni Kui, president of the Huni Kui People’s Federation of the Brazilian Amazon, added: “Our vision is very different to those who make the decisions at Cop. We have ancestral connections to the environment and Mother Earth. These are spiritual spaces that we would never negotiate or offset for money, but the working groups don’t represent the views of our communities or explain what these carbon markets actually mean.”03:04 Cop26 activists demand Biden declare climate emergency at protest held by Indigenous leaders – videoAs the climate crisis intensifies with record floods, fires and heatwaves across the world, so does the violence against defenders. 2020 was the deadliest year on record for environmental and land defenders, with indigenous people accounting for half of the total 227 killed.Many, like Cáceres, had been resisting environmentally destructive extractive industries and energy projects including pipelines, dams, industrial wind and solar farms, and African palm plantations.Still, indigenous peoples have survived against the odds, and they are not giving up.“It’s a testament of our resilience that even after hundreds of years of colonization and betrayal that we indigenous communities are still willing to sacrifice our lives, health and energy for this last-ditch attempt to save the planet,” said Ruth Miller, climate justice director of the Alaska-based Native Movement, a Dena’ina Athabaskan and Ashkenazi Russian Jewish woman, who is a member of the Curyung tribe.“We’re here offering sustainable solutions to the rest of the world that require an ideological shift, not a green industry built on colonialism and repression. It’s up to them if they listen or not.”"
Executive Order on Improving Public Safety and Criminal Justice for Native Americans and Addressing the Crisis of Missing or Murdered Indigenous People,"By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order as follows:Section 1. Policy. The safety and well-being of all Native Americans is a top priority for my Administration. My Administration will work hand in hand with Tribal Nations and Tribal partners to build safe and healthy Tribal communities and to support comprehensive law enforcement, prevention, intervention, and support services.Generations of Native Americans have experienced violence or mourned a missing or murdered family member or loved one, and the lasting impacts of such tragedies are felt throughout the country. Native Americans face unacceptably high levels of violence, and are victims of violent crime at a rate much higher than the national average. Native American women, in particular, are disproportionately the victims of sexual and gender-based violence, including intimate partner homicide. Research shows that approximately half of Native American women have experienced sexual violence and that approximately half have experienced physical violence by an intimate partner. LGBTQ+ Native Americans and people who identify as “Two-Spirit” people within Tribal communities are also often the targets of violence. And the vast majority of Native American survivors report being victimized by a non-Native American individual.For far too long, justice has been elusive for many Native American victims, survivors, and families. Criminal jurisdiction complexities and resource constraints have left many injustices unaddressed. Some progress has been made, particularly on Tribal lands. Given that approximately 70 percent of American Indian and Alaska Natives live in urban areas and part of this epidemic of violence is against Native American people in urban areas, we must continue that work on Tribal lands but also build on existing strategies to identify solutions directed toward the particular needs of urban Native Americans.In 2020, bipartisan members of the 116th Congress took an important step forward through the passage of two pieces of legislation — Savanna’s Act and the Not Invisible Act of 2019 ‑- that include important provisions for improving law enforcement and justice protocols as well as improving access to data to address missing or murdered indigenous people. My Administration is committed to fully implementing these laws and working with the Congress to fund these programs for Native Americans. Earlier this year, the Secretary of the Interior and the Attorney General announced a Joint Commission, established pursuant to the Not Invisible Act, that includes: representatives of Tribal, State, and local law enforcement; Tribal judges; Native American survivors of human trafficking; health care and mental health practitioners who have experience working with Native American survivors of human trafficking and sexual assault; Urban Indian Organizations focused on violence against women and children; and family members of missing or murdered indigenous people. The Commission will work to address the persistent violence endured by Native American families and communities across the country. In addition, the Department of the Interior has established a special unit to focus resources on active and unsolved missing persons cases.But more work is needed to address the crisis of ongoing violence against Native Americans — and of missing or murdered indigenous people. Previous executive action has not achieved changes sufficient to reverse the epidemic of missing or murdered indigenous people and violence against Native Americans. The Federal Government must prioritize addressing this issue and its underlying causes, commit the resources needed to tackle the high rates of violent crime that Native Americans experience over the long term, coordinate and provide resources to collect and analyze data, and work closely with Tribal leaders and community members, Urban Indian Organizations, and other interested parties to support prevention and intervention efforts that will make a meaningful and lasting difference on the ground.It is the policy of my Administration to work directly with Tribal Nations to strengthen public safety and criminal justice in Indian Country and beyond, to reduce violence against Native American people, and to ensure swift and effective Federal action that responds to the problem of missing or murdered indigenous people. My Administration understands that Native American people, particularly the survivors of violence, know best what their communities need to make them safer. Consistent engagement, commitment, and collaboration will drive long-term improvement to public safety for all Native Americans.Sec. 2. Coordination of a Federal Law Enforcement Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Violence Against Native Americans. The Attorney General, working with the Secretary of the Interior and the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies) as appropriate, shall assess and build on existing efforts to develop a coordinated and comprehensive Federal law enforcement strategy to prevent and respond to violence against Native Americans, including to address missing or murdered indigenous people where the Federal Government has jurisdiction. The strategy shall set out a plan to address unsolved cases involving Native Americans; provide for coordination among the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Homeland Security in their efforts to end human trafficking; seek to strengthen and expand Native American participation in the Amber Alert in Indian Country initiative; and build on and enhance national training programs for Federal agents and prosecutors, including those related to trauma-informed and victim-centered interview and investigation techniques. The strategy shall also include protocols for effective, consistent, and culturally and linguistically appropriate communication with families of victims and their advocates, including through the creation of a designated position within the Department of Justice assigned the function of serving as the outreach services liaison for criminal cases where the Federal Government has jurisdiction. The Attorney General and the Secretary of the Interior shall report to the President within 240 days of the date of this order describing the strategy developed and identifying additional resources or other support necessary to implement that strategy.Sec. 3. Supporting Tribal and Other Non-Federal Law Enforcement Efforts to Prevent and Respond to Violence Against Native Americans.(a) The Attorney General and the Secretary of the Interior, working with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall develop guidance, identify leading practices, and provide training and technical assistance, consistent with applicable law and available appropriations, to:(i) assist Tribal governments in implementing special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction pursuant to the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, enabling them to prosecute certain non-Indian defendants for domestic violence and dating violence offenses in Indian Country, and also assist Tribes in implementing any relevant Tribal provisions in subsequent Violence Against Women Act reauthorization legislation;(ii) assist Tribal governments within Oklahoma, consistent with the United States Supreme Court’s decision in McGirt v.

"Indigenous People Gain Voice at Biodiversity Conference, Push to Conserve Amazon","Members of the Congress of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (COICA) at a meeting in 2019. COICA is pushing for greater protections for the Amazon rainforest at a major biodiversity summit this week. UN Climate ChangeIndigenous voices on the environment are finally being heard as Marseille hosts a global biodiversity summit, with a call to protect 80 percent of the Amazon, as well as a “counter conference” highlighting the conservation movement’s historic violation of people’s rights.For the first time in its seven-decade history, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is including Indigenous peoples as full voting members in their own right, rather than under the NGO category. Dozens of Indigenous meetings are happening at the summit — which occurs every four years — with representatives from 23 organizations.Greater inclusion of Indigenous representatives comes as the European “fortress conservation” model, which resulted in vast human rights abuses and an estimated 20 million people displaced from their homelands worldwide since the 19th century, is increasingly being challenged.Historically, the global conservation movement was based on the idea that protected areas flourish free from human disturbance, but a growing body of evidence shows that Indigenous communities are the best at looking after wildlife, and that as much as 80 percent of the world’s remaining forest biodiversity lies within Indigenous peoples’ territories.José Gregorio Díaz Mirabal, a member of Venezuela’s Wakuenai Kurripaco people and coordinator of the Congress of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (COICA), which represents more than 2 million Indigenous people, said they had been fighting for decades to be heard.“We come to the IUCN with our voice and voting rights. We seek to build a new alliance with equal rights on equal terms, but we see that there is still much to do, so much to recognize,” he said.“Less than 1 percent of all the funding that is invested in protecting intact biodiversity and mitigating climate change in our territories reaches our communities, and that has to change. It’s absurd that so much of the funding goes to consultants who are sent to tell us what we already know about how to conserve what we are already conserving.”Representatives from countries across the world will vote on motions this week that will shape future global conservation policy and the allocation of finance. COICA’s Amazonia por la vida (Amazonia for Life) campaign motion is demanding protection of 80 percent of the Amazon basin by 2025 (protected areas and Indigenous territories make up about 45 percent currently) with the emphasis on Indigenous peoples managing those protected areas. They are asking governments to recognize 100 percent of Indigenous land in the Amazon and ban all forms of extractive industries in those areas.A record number of environmental defenders were killed in 2019 for protecting their land, 40 percent of whom were from Indigenous communities. “Science is saying the best-conserved areas are Indigenous territories … yet we have the highest level of murder,” Díaz Mirabal said.“National parks receive funding and support from governments, but when it comes to our Indigenous territories, we’re left to spill our own blood to defend it. Now it is time for our Indigenous territories to be protected with the same level of support and legislation,” he said.As well as showcasing a range of ideas from campaigners, scientists and conservationists, the summit provides policymakers with a chance to discuss issues in the run-up to the COP15 “Paris agreement for nature,” due to be negotiated in Kunming next year. The headline target is likely to be protecting 30 percent of the planet for nature by the end of the decade (the “30x30” target).The draft COP15 agreement includes a clause that traditional knowledge of Indigenous peoples and local communities should guide decision-making “with their free, prior, and informed consent.” But Indigenous groups, academics, and campaigners from 18 countries gathered in Marseille at the “Our Land, Our Nature” congress, a “counter-summit” on the eve of the IUCN meeting, called for land rights to be at the heart of conservation, not protected areas. More than 3,000 people attended the event, either in person or online, which included a protest march through the French city.“The 30x30 target is a structural problem,” said Mordecai Ogada, director of Conservation Solutions Afrika. “We need to rethink the definition of protected areas, those that exist, and we need to look for a more sophisticated model of biodiversity and conservation. That’s where the big organizations have such a challenge, because they find it very difficult to change their own structures.”The alternative summit included representatives from Survival International, Rainforest Foundation UK, and the Minority Rights Group, as well as a number of Indigenous people with different perspectives on the usefulness of protected areas.Juan Pablo Gutiérrez, a representative of the Yukpa people in Colombia but living in exile in France, said areas that governments were designating as “protected” had been safeguarded for years by Indigenous people.“What’s happening with 30x30 is that governments want to distract global opinion by proposing solutions that don’t relate to the real problem at all. If you want to attack climate change, you need to attack the causes that are leading to it,” he said, citing western consumption and overexploitation of resources as the key drivers of ecological destruction.A UN report published earlier this year found Indigenous people in South America were the best at looking after forests, with deforestation 50 percent lower than elsewhere, according to a review of more than 300 studies. Representatives at the Our Land, Our Nature gathering argued that there was little scientific evidence that protecting 30 percent of the planet would stem biodiversity loss. The previous 10-year UN target agreed in 2010 in Aichi, Japan, set goals that by 2020, 17 percent of terrestrial areas and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas would be conserved.Lara Dominguez, a lawyer with the Minority Rights Group, said: “Despite being very close to achieving the 17 percent target in many states, biodiversity loss has reached unprecedented levels. Even though we have more protected areas, it hasn’t actually impacted biodiversity in a positive way.”Dominguez believes these policies are driven more by politics than science and argues that a rights-based approach to conservation would be far more effective.Francisco Ramiro Batzín Chojoj, legal representative of the Guatemala-based Indigenous organization Sotz’il, said it was important that Indigenous people had a seat at the table and that working towards the 30x30 target was “fundamental”.“We are calling for Indigenous people to be respected in all these initiatives because it’s essential they are involved.”Stewart Maginnis, global director of the IUCN’s nature-based solutions group, said: “The 30x30 can and must work to support Indigenous peoples by strengthening their custodianship, voice and rights.“Protection for nature conservation need not and should not exclude people,” he said. “Many of the world’s protected and conserved areas are managed in a way where people and communities live and work within their boundaries.”A UN policy brief on human rights and the environment, released last month, emphasized the need for a dramatic departure from “conservation as usual.” Neville Ash, director of the UN Environment Programme conservation monitoring centre, said Indigenous people and communities who governed large areas of land were often not recognized for their extensive contributions to nature conservation. “This needs to change,” he said.“The draft framework is explicit on the importance of employing rights-based approaches for its implementation, and governments and other actors will need to learn from mistakes of the past and be held accountable for delivering on these future commitments in line with human rights obligations.”—Phoebe Weston, The Guardian"
Telling Indigenous stories: ‘I’m fighting to be heard’,"I’ve been seeking out and sharing the stories of oppression, trauma and brutality that my people continue to endure.I shoot up from the bed in my hotel room, my heart pounding so hard I can hear it echoing outside of my body. It takes me a few seconds to realise I’m not dying, that it’s the recurrent nightmare I have been having for two and a half years, the details of which I don’t always remember. I rush to the toilet and splash water on my face, take a few slow, deep breaths to calm down.This is the norm for me when I’m out reporting on stories of Indigenous Peoples. It’s gotten to the point where I must carry a bottle of prescription sleeping pills to help in case I’m so wound up by adrenaline and stress that I cannot fall asleep. Sometimes, I don’t sleep for days when on assignment, distressed by police intimidation, fearing that the person who sent me a death threat might follow through with it.Each time I go out, it feels like I’m headed into a war zone. A war of oppression, trauma and brutality against those whose stories I’ve been fighting to bring to the world’s attention; in the hope that the world will care and stand with them to demand equality and justice for them.And yet I’m often fighting to be heard in the very industry I work in.There was a time when the voices of Indigenous Peoples were completely silenced. The media played a huge role in that, both in Canada and across the world. Several years ago, I decided to tell these stories after I realised that much of Canadian society had become apathetic to the plight of Indigenous nations.When I became a storyteller over a decade ago, I was hungry to seek out and share the stories of my Indigenous people.It was only a couple of years into my journalism career that I began focusing solely on Indigenous stories after realising that they are often told in a discriminatory and biased way by the mainstream media.I’m what some call mixed blood, French Canadian from my father’s side and Cree/Iroquois through my mother’s family.While reporting, every native elder’s face I looked at, reminded me of my kohkum (grandmother), who passed away in 2008. She was a survivor; of colonisation, residential school abuse and struggled with alcoholism, but she was a warrior; proud of her native roots and loved her family from the depths of her being in her 74 years on this earth.Seeing displaced families, the trauma they have had to endure and the addictions they have been dealing with, brought back memories of my own family’s struggles. Each of us, through several generations, has been impacted by colonial violence, residential school horrors and the devastation that ensued.A troubled relationshipMeanwhile, the media was helping to perpetuate this violence by failing to report on the rampant injustices. And when on the rare occasion the media did report on our communities, they mostly got it wrong. All of it – our people, our culture, our history, our ongoing struggles.I was insulted and heartbroken. So, this work became my life’s mission. But it required determination because going where few have gone before isn’t easy. You have to get your hands dirty, do difficult work on the ground. It is hard to gain the trust of people who are often still hurting from trauma, and to build relationships, to do justice to their stories. And learning the culture, protocols and traditions of each sovereign nation is just the first, but a significant step, in this process. All this extra effort must be put in without any expectation or guarantee of payment for it.These stories often have strong ties to people’s lives, and require a deep dive to explore and expose the multiple layers of systemic abuse and brutality. The mainstream media’s template of storytelling does not even begin to do them justice as it only allows journalists, who are often parachuted in, to barely scratch the surface.To further complicate this, the relationship between Indigenous Peoples and those in the media and the government – mostly non-Indigenous – is troubled. Our stories are interpreted and presented from the white colonial mindset, which dominates mainstream media. A system, which I believe, must be challenged and dismantled.Indigenous journalists are now taking steps to decolonise the media, telling the truths that have never been told. In doing so, they are challenging historical untruths. For too long, there have been colonial power imbalances within the media, enabling the colonial narrative to be put forward.We, as journalists, have the power to amplify the voices of the marginalised, to effect social and political transformation, and to better the lives of those who bear the brunt of widespread abuse.Reclaiming the narrativeDecolonising the media, however, is a foreign concept in media circles.It will require a major shift in the traditional power structures so the reins can be handed back to the people whose stories are being told. As an Indigenous journalist, I understand the importance of sharing these stories through an Indigenous lens, presenting their struggles based on their lived experience and worldview. It is a crucial step towards reclaiming the narrative.Doing this work is about reconciliation too, and that requires two sides. Editors and people in positions of power making key decisions on content need to support and invest in Indigenous and BIPOC storytellers – so our journalism is not dismissed as “activism” or we are not accused of being too close to the story.After all, non-Indigenous journalists are never labelled as activists when they tell stories of and from their communities.This is just one step towards lessening the burden that the Indigenous Peoples have been carrying. There is a whole lot more that needs to change for their issues to be resolved.But there appears to be a lack of political will to take necessary steps to address the challenges that the Indigenous Peoples in Canada are confronted with – the drinking water crises, the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, land dispossession, desolate infrastructure and housing, the overrepresentation of Indigenous population in the prison systems, and the list goes on.I believe it’s because the government and the authorities don’t care and are terrified of being found out. Canada touts its vision of reconciliation to the world as righting the wrongs of the past. But the wrongs are still continuing. Canada is neither ready to face this truth itself nor does it want the world to find out the extent of it. Hence it’s using tactics of delay and bureaucracy to downplay this “race-based genocide”, leading to apathy in the media.But our voices are being heard now and the veil of secrecy is being lifted.The graves of Indigenous children were shown to the world this summer.As an Indigenous journalist, I’ve covered countless harrowing stories of the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. I’ve stood at the places where their bodies were dumped like rubbish. I’ve held their loved ones as they mourned. I’ve cried with survivors of the abuse in the residential school system, those fighting ongoing land displacement, enforced poverty as well as families of those lost to this epidemic of violence. I’ve shared the pain of their injustice.The living and the lostIn a country like Canada, admired by the world as a bastion of human rights, I often wonder how they’ve been able to get away with such atrocities for so long.I’m tired of collecting the stories of dead bodies. I’m done with being treated like I’m someone the perpetrators and powers that be can threaten and intimidate because they want to continue to stifle these truths.I will no longer be silenced or intimidated. I’m determined to fight back to stop the violence that is driven by political, economic, institutional, and societal racism and oppression.Around the world, the lives of our people are in danger every day. Threatened, stolen, beaten, abused, and killed.We are all in this together. Our women are the life-givers, the daughters, the sisters, the caretakers of this earth – they are being violated much like our sacred Mother Earth. And our Mother is tired of the mistreatment and the destruction. She has been roaring in fury – the earthquakes, the wildfires, the storms, the floods, the death, the chaos. These are the cries from our Mother Earth – demanding honour and respect – much like our mothers on this earth long for honour and respect.I add my voice to those who cry out for justice – the living and the lost.I believe we will be heard, we will be seen, and we will kindle the fires of justice across these lands, for generations to come. And we will not stop until the world is ablaze with hope, with peace, and with love.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."
Indigenous peoples to get $1.7bn in recognition of role in protecting forests,"At least $1.7bn of funding will be given directly to indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) in recognition of their key role in protecting the planet’s lands and forests, it will be announced at Cop26 today.The governments of the UK, US, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands are leading the $1.7bn (£1.25bn) funding pledge, which is being announced as part of ambitious global efforts to reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030, with campaigners cautiously hopeful that this conference of the parties (Cop) could be the first to properly champion indigenous peoples’ rights.Tuntiak Katan, a leader of Ecuador’s indigenous Shuar people who serves as general coordinator of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities, said: “We are happy with the financing announcement, but we will be watching for concrete measures that will reveal whether the intent is to transform a system that has directed less than 1% of climate funding to indigenous and local communities. What matters is what happens next.“This Cop is interesting and unprecedented,” he added. “After attending these climate events for years, this one is different. The UK has put tremendous effort into raising our visibility at this Cop.“But the UK is now at a crossroads: they can either use our presence as a photo op, or they can choose to become a global champion for indigenous peoples and local communities.”As indigenous peoples have fought for their rights more publicly in recent years, they have faced increasing persecution. In 2020, a record number of people were killed for protecting their land, with more than a third from indigenous communities.Despite the important role they play in protecting forests, only a small fraction of these communities have secure rights to their land. The funding is recognition that IPLCs are crucial to protecting tropical forests and preserving ecosystems. Leaders will be calling on other countries to respect and protect these rights in accordance with national legislation.While the majority of the money in the fund will come from governments, charitable foundations including the Ford Foundation, Bezos Earth Fund, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Arcadia, Wyss Foundation and the Rainforest Trust are contributing more than $600m.05:33 Indigenous activists on tackling the climate crisis: 'We have done more than any government' – videoDarren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, said the aim was to give IPLCs more of a voice in policymaking and discourse. It is hoped more funding will follow.Walker said: “It’s a first step, it’s a down payment. We ignore these communities at our peril. We have to invest more, we have to support them more.“I’m not asserting that this is the only solution,” he added, “but it’s a critical part of the puzzle of solving climate change and this part of the puzzle needs to be resourced properly.”The money will support IPLCs’ capacity to govern themselves collectively, assist with mapping and registration work, back national land reform and help resolve conflict over territories. It will continue until 2025.Walker said: “We have been wedded to technical, market-based solutions, and have ignored the communities right in front of us who are key to solving the challenge.“This is an historic moment. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change the paradigm and to at last give power and a seat at the table to the people who are critical to the solution. A new paradigm is emerging and we will hear it loud and clear in Glasgow.”The announcement follows a number of studies that show securing indigenous rights and land tenure is an effective way of protecting the environment. A 2021 UN review of more than 300 studies found that deforestation rates in South America were up to 50% lower within areas under indigenous control than elsewhere.It follows an emphasis on including indigenous voices at the International Union for Conservation of Nature conference in Marseille in September. For the first time in its seven-decade history, the IUCN included indigenous peoples as full voting members in their own right, rather than under the NGO category.Paul Redman, founder of If Not Us Then Who?, a US charity that highlights the role indigenous and local peoples play in environmentalism, said: “I think it’s the first time in all the climate conferences I’ve been to since 2013 that leaders really seem to be genuinely engaged and wanting indigenous peoples to be at the table.“The real key is follow-up: money going to indigenous communities and land titles being allocated to indigenous peoples post-Cop.”"
"In southern Colombia, Indigenous groups fish and farm with the floods","The Tikuna, Cocama and Yagua peoples in southern Colombia live on a two-pronged sustainable food system that involves artisanal fishing and communal planting synchronized with the different flooding seasons.The food systems have allowed the 22 communities in the area to live sustainably without damaging the forest’s extremely high rates of biodiversity, according to a report from the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).The communities have faced some challenges in recent decades due to outside pressures to commercialize their activities, raising doubts about how to maintain sustainable practices.This article is part of an eight-part series showcasing sustainable food systems covered in the most comprehensive report to date of the diets and food production practices of Indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs).At the very southern tip of Colombia, Indigenous communities practice a sustainable food system that involves artisanal fishing and rotating crop structures within cycles of flooding periods. This has allowed them to live sustainably in an extremely biodiverse part of the Amazon that has remained largely untouched by commercial agriculture.The Tikuna, Cocama and Yagua peoples of Puerto Nariño use handmade arrows, hooks and spurs to practice artisanal fishing in local rivers while also growing cassava, pineapple, corn, rice and chestnuts on communal land, according to a report from the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The new report provides the most detailed and comprehensive account to date of the sustainable food systems of Indigenous peoples.The report says local communities like those in Puerto Nariño should be key players in the 2030 agenda to end poverty, food insecurity and promote responsible forest management, among other things.“Indigenous peoples’ wisdom, traditional knowledge and ability to adapt provide lessons from which other non-indigenous societies can learn,” Anne Nuorgam, chair of the U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, said in the report, “especially when designing more sustainable food systems that mitigate climate change and environmental degradation.”The 22 Indigenous communities living in Puerto Nariño may have even more lessons to pass on because they have developed not one unique food system, but two.Rotating production and flood seasonsMany of the nearly 7,000 residents structure their diet around the chagra, forest plots less than a hectare (2.5 acres) in size that each family clears to grow more than 80 different kinds of fruits, vegetables and tubers, as well as 28 species of trees. Community members also depend on their chagras for hunting animals such as the black agouti (Dasyprocta fuliginosa), red howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus), yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulatus) and tapir (Tapirus terrestris).The chagras also serve as a social gathering place, where different families in the community come to help each other with some of the more laborious aspects of maintaining the food system, such as felling trees, planting new seeds and making crafts. Known as mingas, this communal work can be seen within various Indigenous communities across Latin America.“It is more than a place,” report author Liseth Escobar, of Fundación Omacha, a Colombian NGO, told Mongabay. “It’s also an information system that they use to teach their kids how to produce food. It’s viewed as a family project that must be maintained because this is what they survive from.”The rainforest doesn’t have especially fertile soil for cultivation, the report points out, but because maintaining a chagra involves composting and laying organic fertilizer, the communities are able to rely on the harvest for about 50% of their diet.The communities are also surrounded by the Loretoyacu and Amazon rivers and several lakes and lagoons, where they’ve developed fisheries that provide most of their protein. Approximately 68 different species of fish are pulled from local waters, according to the report.Expert fishermen know the feeding and reproductive habits of every fish consumed by the community, the report says. They’re viewed as caretakers of the ecosystems and decide what and when to hunt based on a calendar that follows the rise and fall of the local waterbodies.For example, they only catch pacu (Piaractus brachypomus) when the waters are low, high or falling, but not when they’re in the process of rising. The redeye piranha (Serrasalmus rhombeus), meanwhile, is caught exclusively while the waters are rising.The report describes how the flood season begins in February, bringing fish to new areas of the flooded forest to reproduce and fertilize the soil. Come May, the waters recede and attract more land mammals that can be hunted. The shifting focus on different parts of the ecosystem allows biodiversity to rebound from what residents consume.Forests fertilized during the high-water seasons provide the community with wild fruits and vegetables, such as cocoa (Theobroma cacao), while creating rich soil for plants for cultivation, like guava (Psidium guajava). Other foods can be grown year-round regardless of flooding. Of the 22 communities in Puerto Nariño, 15 use these practices exclusively for subsistence consumption, the report says, while the rest sell any extra that they can’t eat themselves at local markets.“In terms of food, we don’t need to buy anything. We have more than enough food,” Juan Ramos, a fisherman, said as quoted in the report. He added, “Nor do we need to produce a lot, because then the food goes to waste, and we have to sell it at a ridiculous price.”Outside pressures threaten traditional customsDespite the success of their system, the Tikuna, Cocama and Yagua still feel the pressure to alter their practices to include commercial agriculture.In the 1970s, the introduction of nylon nets and other fishing technology started pushing many people away from artisanal practices. Government programs also attempted to introduce the community to cattle ranching.“People think that Indigenous communities in the Amazon live in peace and isolation,” Escobar said. “But it’s not true. The Amazon has also been involved in globalization.”She added, “These communities in the ’70s and ’80s started commercial fishing and hunting, and what happened? Almost everything was destroyed.”In 1991, with the passing of a new Constitution in Colombia, Puerto Nariño residents were recognized as citizens for the first time, having previously been considered Peruvian. The Constitution gave them communal autonomy over their territories, and they used this new power to return to the chagras and artisanal fishing — albeit with more focus on selling food products at markets.Due in part to the effects of commercial agriculture, it would take almost 30 years for biodiversity to recover in the area, Escobar said. And in that time, the government continued to implement other policies that, although intended to improve quality of life, ultimately threatened communal traditions.For example, younger generations today are struggling to learn the native language because Colombia mandates that Spanish be taught in the classroom. The arrival of processed foods from other parts of the country, especially those provided in schools, have led some younger residents to resist traditional foods, claiming that they prefer the taste of processed products.At the same time, some aquatic species are being overfished due to rising demand from local, regional and even international markets, Escobar said, which could have long-term impacts on community traditions.“When we lose biodiversity,” she said, “we also lose the human knowledge of that species. In the case of Indigenous peoples, if they lose certain larger fish, they also lose their practices because that fish is no longer present in the ecosystem.”Community leaders have tried organizing programs to educate younger generations on the fishing calendar and other sustainable practices. And a newly formed association of Indigenous councils has attempted to streamline conservation efforts. However, not everyone in the community is happy with the leaders’ decisions.According to the report, more collaborative efforts need to be made between the community, academic circles, the government and NGOs to strengthen knowledge exchange from older generations to younger ones.“Not all of us are clear about the roles of our leaders, and not even the leaders themselves are clear,” Sergio Silva, a member of the Comunidad Ticoya council, said in the report. “The problem is that we remain silent.”Banner image: A member of the Indigenous Tikuna nation paddling a dugout canoe on a tributary of the Amazon in Colombia by Rhett A.

Canada: Catholic Church apologises 'unequivocally' for indigenous people abuse in schools,"Catholic Church on Friday ""unequivocally"" aplogised to Canada's indigenous people for about a century of abuse at church-run residential schools which were set up by government to assimilate indigenous children into mainstream. However, indigenous leaders are still waiting for mea culpa from the pope himself.""We, the Catholic Bishops of Canada, express our profound remorse and apologize unequivocally,"" read a statement, in which they said they were ""fully committed"" to reconciliation.The issue of abuses in church-run schools in Canada hit international headlines after discoveries of about 1200 unmarked graves at three sites where indigenous children were forced to attend the schoolsIn total, some 150,000 Indian, Metis and Inuit children were enrolled from the late 1800s to the 1990s in 139 of the residential schools across Canada, spending months or years isolated from the families.Also Read | At least 200 indigenous children went missing or died after entering a hospital in QuebecIt also comes less than a week before Canadians mark the first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation on September 30.The solemn commemoration for the thousands of indigenous children who died or went missing from the schools was set by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said in June that Canadians were ""horrified and ashamed of how our country behaved.""In the statement, the bishops said they ""acknowledge the suffering experienced"" by indigenous students and the ""grave abuses"" inflicted upon them, including ""physical, psychological, emotional, spiritual, cultural, and sexual"" mistreatment at the hands of headmasters and teachers.""Many Catholic religious communities and dioceses participated in this system, which led to the suppression of Indigenous languages, culture and spirituality, failing to respect the rich history, traditions and wisdom of Indigenous Peoples,"" they said.""We also sorrowfully acknowledge the historical and ongoing trauma and the legacy of suffering and challenges faced by Indigenous Peoples that continue to this day,"" it was said.(With inputs from agencies)"
"A look at its indigenous people, residential school system","New Delhi: In a gruesome discovery last week, a burial site with the remains of 215 unidentified children was found in Canada on the grounds of what used to be one of the country’s biggest residential schools, Kamloops Indian Residential School.The residential school system, which operated from the 1880s to the late 1990s, was set up by the Canadian government and administered by churches to assimilate indigenous children into Canadian society.As the country continues to grapple with the discovery, indigenous leaders have raised calls to excavate school burial sites across Canada.“All these families have no idea what happened to them (children), they would want closure, questions answered and a thorough search,” Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) Chief Bobby Cameron, said in an interview.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Monday expressed grief over the situation and said that excavating more sites “is an important part of discovering the truth”.Meanwhile, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennet recently announced a 24×7 hotline to provide support to former students of residential schools and those affected.A National Indian Residential School Crisis Line is available to provide support to former residential school students and those affected.

The deaths are believed to be undocumented.What prompted the excavation is not mentioned in local reports.The school, which was closed in the late 1970s, is located in Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation. First Nations refer to a section of indigenous inhabitants of Canada, along with Inuits and Métis people.First Nations are governed by the ‘Indian Act’, which means they elect chiefs and councils to make decisions on their behalf and pass by-laws in a limited number of areas.Chief Harvey McLeod, of the Upper Nicola First Nation who attended Kamloops Indian Residential School as a child, told Canadian daily Toronto Star last week that it was “common knowledge” that some kids would go missing, though it was never spoken of openly.Operating between 1890 and 1969, the Kamloops school had as many as 500 students registered. The federal government took over the facility’s operation from the Catholic Church and ran it as a day school for nine years until it closed in 1978.According to Rosanne Casimir, Chief of Tk’emlups te Secwépemc First Nation, some of the bodies discovered on school grounds were as young as three years old.According to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC), at least 51 children died at the school between 1914 and 1963.The commission, active from 2008 to 2015, was borne out of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement — a landmark class action lawsuit that recognised the damage inflicted by the residential schools.Also read: On Slave Trade Remembrance Day, a look at how world has confronted legacy of slavery, racismIndigenous people of CanadaIn Canada, the term ‘Indigenous peoples’ (or Aboriginal peoples) refers to First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples who make up 4.9 per cent of the national population, according to a 2016 census.After Europeans established permanent settlements in the 17th and 18th centuries, they were severely threatened by colonial forces. They lost an estimated 98 per cent of their land and were forced to live in isolated reserves.First Nations (a contemporary term for “Indian”) were the original inhabitants of the land that is now Canada, occupying territories south of the Arctic. The Inuits (contemporary term for “Eskimo”) mainly inhabit the northern regions of Canada. Métis peoples are of mixed European and Indigenous ancestry and live mostly in the Prairie provinces and Ontario.In 1876, the Canadian government passed the Indian Act which became the primary law used to administer “Indian” status, local First Nations governments and the management of reserve land.What was the residential school system?Between 1831 and 1996, Canada’s residential school system forcibly separated more than 1.5 lakh First Nations children from their families in order to assimilate them into the Euro-Canadian and Christian ways of living. They were forbidden to acknowledge their indigenous heritage and culture or to speak their own languages.According to an information resource set up by the University of British Columbia, children were subjected to physical, sexual, emotional, and psychological abuse. Their education relied on prayer, manual labour, light industry like woodworking and domestic work.Theodore Fontaine, late chief of Sagkeeng First Nation and a residential school survivor, wrote in his memoirs: “Looking back on my years at school, I remember fondly some nuns, priests and others who I think were truly there in the belief that they could help us adjust to a foreign way of life.”A TRC report notes that until the 1950s, students both lived and were educated in the same institution but under the integration policy of the 1950s, some students lived in hostels and were educated in day schools. The last residential school closed in 1996.On 8 March 2006, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, the largest class action settlement in Canadian legal history, was issued. It entailed a Common Experience Payment (CEP) to be paid to all former residential school students, setting up of TRC and more.In 2008, then Prime Minister Stephen Harper publicly issued an apology, on behalf of the Government of Canada, to all indigenous people acknowledging the country’s role in the residential school system.Also read: World’s oldest water found in Canada, Oxford researchers say it dates back 1.6 billion years"
Explained: Why indigenous groups in Canada want a nationwide search for children’s mass graves,"Last week, the remains of over 215 children were found at a former residential school in Canada’s British Columbia. This has prompted Indigenous groups to call for a nationwide search for such mass graves.Residential schools that operated from around the 1880s onwards were set up by Canada’s government and were run by churches with the goal of assimilation of Indigenous children, in order to eliminate the cultural differences that the missionaries and European settlers saw between themselves and the Indigenous Peoples, who comprise about five percent of Canada’s population currently.Newsletter | Click to get the day’s best explainers in your inboxSo what is happening?On May 27, the Tk’emlups te Secwepemc First Nation community said that with the help of a ground penetrating radar specialist, they were able to locate the remains of 215 children at the Kamloops Indian Residential school in Canada’s British Columbia. The finding has sparked outrage, prompting demands that a nationwide search be made for such mass graves.Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has concluded that such Residential Schools were “a systematic, government- sponsored attempt to destroy Aboriginal cultures and languages and to assimilate Aboriginal peoples so that they no longer existed as distinct peoples.”TRC has also likened the motivations of opening and operating these schools to “cultural genocide”.Residential schools of CanadaResidential schools encompassed a schooling system set up by the Canadian government and administered by churches. The aim was to educate Indigenous children but also to indoctrinate them into “Euro-Canadian and Christian ways of living and assimilating them into mainstream white Canadian society,” an article on the website of University of British Columbia (UBC) notes.The Kamloops Residential school was operational from May, 1890 to July 1978 and was opened by the Roman Catholic administration. Officially, residential schools operated from 1880s onwards and ran until the latter half of the 1900s. In 1920, the Indian Act made attendance at the Indian Residential Schools compulsory for Treaty-status children between the ages of seven and 15.The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR), which was set up with the mandate of preserving a record of human rights abuses and promoting research and learning about residential schools, notes that out of the 150,000 students who attended these residential schools, many never returned home because they either ran away or died.Also in Explained | Politics and history behind France seeking ‘forgiveness’ from Rwanda for 1994 genocideWhat happened at these schools?This kind of a schooling system forcefully separated children from their families “for extended periods of time and forbade them to acknowledge their Indigenous heritage and culture or to speak their own languages” , the UBC article notes. The Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement has identified 139 such residential schools for the purpose of providing compensation to former students.These schools are believed to have been overcrowded, and offered a poor standard of education and a very regimented schedule to the children. These schools were also underfunded, where education was limited to imparting practical skills. For instance, girls in the school were taught to do domestic chores such as sewing, laundry, cooking and cleaning. Boys, on the other hand, were taught skills such as carpentry and farming.A government medical inspector notes in 1907 that 24 per cent of previously healthy Indigenous children put in these schools were dying across Canada. But this is probably an underestimation, since it does not include the children who died at home. The schools sent critically ill students home. The UBC article says that the medical inspector noted that somewhere between 47-75 per cent of the children who were sent back home died shortly after.What is the government’s stance on this?Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday said searching for the mass graves is an important part of discovering the truth, Reuters reported. But he did not make any specific comments.An article published in Foreign Policy in December 2020 noted that while Trudeau promoted himself as a pro-Indigenous candidate during elections, he “has, for the most part, shied away from direct federal government intervention in conflict resolution and failed to deliver on campaign promises.”"
Indigenous people in Canada grapple with ‘unthinkable loss’,"Remains of 215 Indigenous children were found at a former residential school in the province of British Columbia this week.Indigenous people across Canada are grappling with the discovery of the remains of more than 200 Indigenous children, including some as young as three, at the site of a former residential school in the western province of British Columbia this week.Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation chief Rosanne Casimir announced (PDF) on Thursday that the remains of 215 children were found on the grounds of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, saying “an unthinkable loss that was spoken about but never documented” had been confirmed.“To our knowledge, these missing children are undocumented deaths,” Casimir said.“Some were as young as three years old. We sought out a way to confirm that knowing out of deepest respect and love for those lost children and their families, understanding that Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc is the final resting place of these children.”The discovery of the mass grave has spurred “a collective pain and trauma” for Indigenous communities across Canada, said Danielle Morrison, an Anishinaabe lawyer. “Currently there [are] fires being lit, pipes are being lit, and ceremonies being held to honour all of those lost lives of those precious children,” she told Al Jazeera.“This news is a stark reminder of the violence inflicted by the residential school system and the wounds carried by communities, families and Survivors into the present,” the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation at the University of Manitoba also said in a statement.For more than 100 years, Canadian authorities forcibly separated thousands of Indigenous children from their families and made them attend residential schools, which aimed to sever Indigenous family and cultural ties and assimilate the children into white Canadian society.The schools, which were run by churches from the 1870s until 1996, were rife with physical, mental and sexual abuse, neglect, and other forms of violence, and they created a cycle of intergenerational trauma for Indigenous people across Canada.Founded in 1890 and run by the Catholic Church, the Kamloops Indian Residential School eventually became the largest school in Canada’s residential school system, counting 500 children at its enrollment peak in the early 1950s.“The residential schools were opened with the sole purpose of removing the Indian from the child,” Morrison said. “It was to assimilate Indigenous people in Canada and it’s essentially, in the words of one of the superintendents at the time, to get rid of the ‘Indian problem’.”During an online commemoration on Saturday, Karen Joseph, CEO of the Reconciliation Canada charity, said the discovery in Kamloops marked the first time a “whispered knowing was made real” and its effect is being felt across the country, especially by residential school survivors.This is the legacy of Canadian colonialism. A legacy educators today need to be mindful of, since education has always been used in Canada to harm Indigenous students, familes and communities. To teach us we're wrong. My heart goes out to the families.https://t.co/4WOgcLBxDQ — Alicia Elliott (@WordsandGuitar) May 28, 2021“Although those children that we are referring to right now went to the Kamloops Indian Residential School, we know that all of those children were not from Kamloops. That was the nature of residential schools, it was to take our children as far away from our homelands,” Joseph said.“The grief is not localised into that community, and it is a huge burden that they are carrying right now.”‘Cultural genocide’In 2015, a national truth and reconciliation commission said the Canadian government had committed “cultural genocide” by forcing more than 150,000 Indigenous children to attend residential schools.“The question of what happened to their loved ones and where they were laid to rest has haunted families and communities,” the commission said in its report, about the children who never returned home. “Throughout the history of Canada’s residential school system, there was no effort to record across the entire system the number of students who died while attending the schools each year.”More than 4,100 children died due to disease or in an accident at the schools have been identified to date, the commission said, but efforts continue to identify others.Derek Fox, deputy grand chief of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation in Ontario, said on Saturday that the discovery in Kamloops “shows how the legacy of the Residential School system continues to impact the lives of Residential School survivors and the families of those who never returned home”.“Even after all these years there are new tragedies of the Residential School system coming to light,” Fox said in a statement.Instead of thoughts and prayers @MinJusticeEn @CrownIndigenous @Min_IndServ @JustinTrudeau stop fighting First Nations children and residential school survivors in court and end genocide that is murdered and missing Indigenous women. #genocide #IndianPolicy #humanrights — Pam Palmater (@Pam_Palmater) May 29, 2021The Canadian government formally apologised for the residential school system in 2008, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday that the discovery of the children’s bodies “is a painful reminder of that dark and shameful chapter of our country’s history”.In an open letter to Trudeau on Saturday, Chief R Stacey Laforme of Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation urged him to lower flags across Canada and declare a national day of mourning for the children.But observers have pointed out that residential school survivors have been forced to sue Ottawa to seek reparations and accountability for what happened to them.Last year, CBC News reported the government had spent 3.2 million Canadian dollars ($2.6m) fighting a group of survivors of St Anne’s Indian Residential School, an Ontario residential school rife with abuse, in court over a 10-year period.Others have also pointed out that while the residential schools may be closed, Indigenous children continue to be taken away from their families in disproportionate numbers across Canada.According to census data, more than 52 percent of children in foster care in 2016 were Indigenous, while Indigenous children made up only 7.7 percent of the country’s total population.“This is not a historical event,” said Joseph during the online event on Saturday. “This continues today – the loss of our children and the loss of our people for no other reason than the colour of our skin.”"
Indigenous Peoples’ resilience: Supporting solutions from within,"Photo: ShutterstockWhen COVID-19 hit, Indigenous peoples feared for the lives of their elders and the survival of their cultures. Despite lockdowns, there seemed to be a surge in territorial invasions, contributing to the ensuing spread of the virus in their remote communities. Many were without water, sanitation and days away from the closest health clinics. Indigenous leaders called for help to mobilize food, water, soap, PPE, thermometers, and tests. Surprisingly, some of the most desperate stories were coming from Indigenous communities that, prior to the pandemic, had in many cases fared better economically, given their links with tourism, external markets, and informal urban employment. Relief efforts were also difficult. The rollout of emergency response programs often indirectly excluded Indigenous Peoples through eligibility requirements, such as electricity bills, and delivery mechanisms, such as urban grocery stores.In the midst of this crisis, Indigenous Peoples turned inwards to find resilience. As stories of COVID spreading through their communities began to reach global headlines, so too emerged accounts of Indigenous-led health brigades. These brigades, alongside traditional healers, became among the primary and in many cases the only source of relief for many Indigenous communities. As one quote read: “More than vulnerability, we Indigenous peoples have demonstrated resilience over centuries of pandemics, and this will not be the last time.” This message would become a reality in the images of Amazonian Indigenous women with banana leaf face masks and in the mobilization of Indigenous leaders to collect and deliver fresh food to their more vulnerable brothers and sisters.So, what made some Indigenous peoples resilient and others not? Why was it that some Indigenous peoples, who were better off pre-pandemic, were among the most desperate, while others were able to self-organize, avoid infection, maintain food security, and help others?Today, the world is at a moment of inflection where questions of building back societies that are more inclusive and sustainable are highly prevalent. Beyond the pandemic, Indigenous and other vulnerable groups are facing devastating impacts from climate change. To understand what has driven resilience for Indigenous Peoples during the pandemic and recent extreme climate events, the World Bank has leveraged its ongoing dialogue with Indigenous leaders and recently carried out a pilot study in Central America where 15 Indigenous communities were surveyed in six countries. The findings of the survey will be published in the next few months. Three critical factors emerged: natural capital, cultural capital, and social capital.Natural CapitalDuring the pandemic, it was those Indigenous Peoples with secure rights and access to lands and natural resources that were able to produce food, gather plants and herbs for medicine, and isolate to avoid contagion. The Central American surveys found that 60 percent of respondents deemed that access to biodiversity was the most important resource for their community’s survival during the pandemic, far above income or subsidies from governments or international cooperation.Cultural CapitalTraditional knowledge, medicine, and non-monetary economies have been critical for Indigenous peoples to leverage their natural capital for survival. Traditional medicine has been the primary, and in many cases, the only health resource for Indigenous peoples during the pandemic. The Central American surveys found that traditional healers far outnumber western health specialists working within Indigenous communities. Within the communities surveyed, 97% of respondents reported relying on traditional medicine to treat their health needs during the pandemic, and of these, 80% reported midwives as the primary care source for pregnant women.Traditional Indigenous economies were vital for food security. These economies rely on a collective organization of production and care for the most vulnerable through the exchanges of food, seeds, medicine among families and communities. Among the 15 communities surveyed, seven had highly active traditional economies with 70 percent or more of their food attained through self-production or inter-communal trade. Of these, five reported no food shortages or hunger over the past year. To the contrary, the three communities who reported the most severe food shortages and hunger had a much higher dependence on purchasing food from external sources. For example, an Embera community in Chargre, near Panama City, who was dedicated entirely to tourism and enjoyed a relatively low poverty rate (23 percent) pre-pandemic, found themselves without food or income once the pandemic hit. Their survival depended greatly on the solidarity of others, including that of the much poorer Embera communities (48-70 percent), living within their ancestral territories, who sent food for over three months.Social CapitalSocial cohesion and solidarity are at the foundation of Indigenous cultures throughout the world. Communities with strong traditional governance structures were able to close community borders, organize support for the most vulnerable within their communities, broadly distribute seeds, activate traditional economies for food production, and coordinate efforts with government authorities. The Central American surveys found that in 12 of 15 communities women managed the family income and led efforts to mobilize limited family savings and community bank resources for the most vulnerable.Over the last year, the World Bank has put forward different frameworks committing the institution to principles around inclusion and sustainability, including through the COVID-19 Response and Recovery, Building back through a Green, Resilient, and Inclusive Development Model (GRID) and a Climate Change Action Plan (2021-2025). These frameworks create a platform for the Bank to support Indigenous Peoples’ resilience. Experience witnessed globally and lessons from the Bank’s ongoing dialogues with Indigenous Peoples indicate that supporting their resilience will require nuanced approaches that recognize, safeguard, and empower their own capital—which is highly intertwined with their secure access to lands and natural resources and their traditional knowledge, medicine, and economies.RELATEDIndigenous Peoples at the World BankSocial Sustainability and Inclusion at the World Bank"
'The Olympic Charter contradicts many indigenous physical activities',"Down To Earth speaks to Christian Wacker, president, International Society of Olympic Historians, about indigenous people at the Olympics(Left) Tom Longboat, an Iroquois long distance runner who represented Canada at the beginning of the last century. Patty Mills (Right), an NBA star, is Aboriginal Australian. He led the Australian contingent this year at Tokyo. Photo: Wikimedia CommonsThe 2020 Olympic Games ended in Tokyo, Japan, in early August. Though they played in empty stadiums, athletes nevertheless put up marvellous displays of power, beauty and the spirit of sports. Sports teach us a lot about ourselves. But what role do they play in the lives of the world’s indigenous communities?Do indigenous people make better sportspersons? Certainly, India’s Olympic squad has always had several members from Adivasi areas, with many bringing laurels for the country. At the global level too, the performance of Cathy Freeman in the 2000 Sydney Olympics is remembered to this day. Yet, why are there exclusive events like the World Indigenous Games?To get answers to these questions, Down To Earth spoke to Christian Wacker, the president of the ISOH, The international Society of Olympic Historians. Edited excerpts from the interview:Rajat Ghai: Is there a difference in the outlook of indigenous peoples towards sporting activity and the one presented in the Olympic Charter?Christian Wacker: On a competitive level, physical activities and sport are part of cultural expression and have always been practiced by humankind. Indigenous people, like all ethnic groups, have their specific traditions regarding physical and sporting activities.It should not be forgotten that we all belong to some sort of ethnic groups and have our own expressions. Cultural diversity also means diversity in physical performance.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and later, the Olympic Charter, were created at a time when nation-states began to form around the world and gradually replaced monarchies.One of the principles that Pierre de Coubertin, the IOC’s founder defined when shaping the framework for the future Olympics was that nations should compete peacefully against each other.Therefore, athletes should belong to nations and not to cultures, ethnicities or tribes. Also, the competitive element following British sports principles is a key asset at the Olympics.Both, belonging to a nation and competition, contradict many cultural and indigenous physical activities and by nature are not compatible.RG: Has Global Sport, including the Olympics, appropriated indigenous sports and culture? Please give examples.CW: Global sports need globally accepted rules and procedures that do not exclude indigenous people. But ethnic specifications are hardly adopted globally.Nevertheless, all sports and physical activities derive from specific cultural contexts before they became international.Surfing is a prominent example. It is culturally related to Hawaii but got globally adopted and therefore, globally practiced. Beach volleyball had been played at Brazilian beaches and today, teams from Scandinavia are among the best in the world.German gymnastics is also a good example of cultural sports being adopted worldwide. It was originally not even meant to be competitive. But it got tailored to the needs of global practicality and still has outstanding popularity.RG: How different was the Olympics in 2021 for a Patty Mills from what it was for a Tom Longboat in 1908?CW: Societies a century ago had been hierarchical and elitist, defining the positions of everybody inside a nation.Indigenous athletes of the early 20th century participated in the Olympics as representatives of a nation and not as part of a tribe and received credits for that. But not as indigenous people.Our societies today are diverse and promote themselves as tolerant and having respect for human rights. The situation for indigenous sport stars is different and many of them use their popularity to promote their needs and rights as indigenous people.RG: What challenges do indigenous athletes face in mainstream Global Sport, including the Olympics, compared to those not from an indigenous background?CW: Global Sport is driven by ‘national belonging’ and 'competition'. You have to accept it, if you want to play a leading role in it. Cultural sportive expression has nearly no space in it.RG: Does indigenous representation of modern nation-states in sporting events help in reconciliation or represents a moral dilemma?CW: Nearly all nation-states of our world are political and / or historical constructions. Sometimes, they represent dominant cultures of their territories or create new ones like the former USSR.Indigenous representation inside nation-states at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Tokyo mostly meant a domination of one culture over the other. Let us also remember that currently, 574 recognised Native American tribes are living inside the territory of the United States.Physical expression of the diverse cultures around the world must be preserved and promoted, but cannot be squeezed into the systems of global sports that we know."
South American Indigenous groups unite to demand urgent protection for uncontacted tribe,"- Organizations representing hundreds of thousands of Indigenous people in South America make public appeal for action- Fate of unique uncontacted tribe now at a “tipping point” between survival and extermination- Paraguay’s government has stood by and watched for years as illegal deforestation threatens the group- Urgent call for the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations to interveneLeading Indigenous organizations from across South America have made an unprecedented public appeal for urgent action to prevent the genocide of one of the most threatened uncontacted tribes in the world.Uncontacted members of Paraguay’s Ayoreo tribe are the last uncontacted Indigenous people in South America outside the Amazon.Uncontacted Ayoreo on the day they were forced out of the forest, 2004. © GAT/SurvivalVast swathes of the once-extensive Chaco forest have been cut down all around them, so the Ayoreo now live in an ever-shrinking island of forest surrounded by a sea of destruction. The area suffers the fastest rate of deforestation in the world.Although contacted members of the tribe submitted a formal land claim to the authorities in 1993, only some parcels of land have been returned to them (following lengthy battles). Most of the Ayoreo’s ancestral forest remains in private hands, and it is being rapidly bulldozed for beef production. The beef is exported mainly to Chile, Russia and Brazil, while most of the leather is exported to the EU, almost entirely to Italy.In the face of this imminent threat to the Ayoreo’s survival, leading Indigenous organizations across South America have now made an extraordinary public appeal for action.They include:- AIDESEP (inter-ethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest) [represents Indigenous communities across Peru’s Amazon]- CAOI (Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Andes)- COIAB (Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon)- COICA (Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin)- CONFENIAE (Confederation of Indigenous Nations of the Ecuadorian Amazon)- FENAMAD (Native Federation of Madre de Dios, Peru)- ONIC (National Indigenous Organization of Colombia)- ORPIA (Regional Organization of the Indigenous Peoples of Amazonas State, Venezuela)- ORPIO (Regional Organization of Indigenous Peoples of the Eastern Amazon, Peru)- UNIVAJA (Union of Indigenous Peoples of the Javari Valley, Brazil)In their public appeal they demand that:- the Ayoreo’s lands be returned and titled to them as a matter of urgency;- the ranching businesses now occupying their land be expelled;- the territory then be properly monitored and protected to prevent future destruction.Illegal deforestation now penetrating the very heart of the uncontacted Ayoreo territory. © SurvivalThe organizations, and the Ayoreo, believe that only if outside bodies such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights intervene, will the Paraguayan government do anything to stop the destruction.Survival International, which has worked with the Ayoreo since the 1980s, is coordinating a worldwide email action and Twitter storm on February 23.One of the contacted Ayoreo leaders, Porai Picanerai, said: “If the state refuses to act when we protest at the invasion of our territory, the cattle ranchers will occupy all our land, our relatives will die and we could soon disappear too.”Teresa Mayo, head of Survival’s Ayoreo campaign, said today: “This unprecedented and unique appeal for the Ayoreo by Indigenous organizations from across South America shows how serious the situation now is. Despite the grave threats to their own survival, they can see just how urgent and desperate the Ayoreo case is.“For years the Paraguayan authorities have stood by and watched as the Ayoreo’s priceless forest goes up in smoke. Satellite images from recent decades show a truly horrifying rate of destruction. It’s now only major international pressure that can prevent the total destruction of the uncontacted Ayoreo people, and the forests they have cared for for so long.”"
‘Exceptional’ times could secure indigenous people seat ‘at the table’,"While the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed inequalities faced by the world’s indigenous people, such as poor access to healthcare, it has also led to greater understanding of their priorities, which include social cohesion and protecting the planet.That’s the opinion of Ghazali Ohorella, an international lawyer and indigenous rights advocate who is an Alifuru from Maluku, which is part of Indonesia.Dianne Penn spoke to Mr. Ohorella ahead of the annual UN commemoration of the International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples on 9 August.He expressed why global dialogue on post-pandemic recovery, including to address climate change, biodiversity loss and other challenges, could see indigenous people finally sitting “at the table” instead of being “on the menu”.But first Mr. Ohorella explained where he is from."
Brazil court upholds ban on missionaries trying to contact isolated Indigenous,"Brazil’s highest court has upheld a ban on missionaries entering reserves that are home to isolated and recently contacted Indigenous people during the pandemic.The decision comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Indigenous organizations against a law passed in July 2020 that allowed missionaries to remain inside these reserves despite the pandemic, in violation of Brazil’s official policy in place since 1987.According to Indigenous organizations, it’s crucial to reaffirm the non-contact policy under the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro that has pushed to “integrate” Indigenous people into society, and has been cozy with the evangelical movement.Besides the risk of disease spread, the presence of missionaries in these reserves undermines traditional cultures and social cohesion, and compels these nomadic communities to settle down, making the land more vulnerable to invasions by illegal ranchers and loggers, activists say.Brazil’s highest court has upheld a ban on missionary activity inside reserves that are home to isolated or recently contacted Indigenous people, in a bid to protect the communities against COVID-19.Although the country’s official indigenist policy toward these groups since 1987 has been to not engage in any contact, regardless of whether there’s a pandemic, a federal law passed in July 2020 allows religious missionaries to remain inside these reserves. This triggered a lawsuit by Indigenous and political organizations, which the Supreme Federal Court (STF) has now ruled in favor of.The 2020 law attempted to “legitimize something that is already forbidden,” said Carolina Ribeiro Santana, a lawyer for the Observatory for the Human Rights of Isolated and Recently Contacted Indigenous Peoples (OPI), one of the co-authors of the lawsuit. “As we are under an anti-Indigenous government, it is important to have a decision which reassures the Indigenous policy.”OPI authored the lawsuit along with the Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (Apib) — the country’s largest Indigenous organization — and the Workers Party (PT). Justice Luís Roberto Barroso issued the court’s ruling on Sept. 24.Last year, the court had already forbidden the entry of outsiders into these areas while hearing another case where Indigenous organizations urged the federal government to implement measures, including imposing sanitary barriers, to protect the Indigenous population from COVID-19. “In the current situation, where there is an ongoing pandemic, the peoples in isolation and recent contact are the most exposed to the risk of contagion and extinction,” Barroso said in that earlier ruling.But threats against uncontacted Indigenous groups have escalated under the government of President Jair Bolsonaro, who has called for Indigenous people to be “integrated into society.” Bolsonaro’s hostility toward Indigenous people is no secret; last year, in his weekly live transmission on social media, he declared that, “more and more, the Indigenous is a human being just like us.”At the same time, Bolsonaro is hugely popular with Brazil’s evangelicals, who are credited with helping him win the 2018 election. (His middle name translates to “Messiah.”) Once in office, he appointed evangelical leaders to key posts in his administration, including Ricardo Lopes Dias, who, until November 2020, headed the department responsible for protecting isolated and recently contacted communities at Funai, the Indigenous affairs agency. Dias was a pastor with the New Tribes Mission, an evangelical group notorious for reportedly spreading disease among the Zo’é people living in northern Pará state. More than a third of the Zo’é population subsequently died. Another top official, Damares Alves, the minister for women, family and human rights, is also reportedly linked to missionary groups, according to BBC News Brasil.“These people choose isolation,” anthropologist Aparecida Vilaça, from the National Museum of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, told Mongabay in a phone interview. “What the state has to do is to not let anyone get in.”One of the reasons for this isolation, according to Indigenous organizations, is precisely the trauma of almost being exterminated by the diseases brought by non-Indigenous people, like influenza, measles and malaria; Indigenous people, especially isolated ones, don’t have immunity to many of these pathogens.But the threat of disease isn’t the only one introduced by missionaries, even to non-isolated groups. According to lawyer Eliésio Marubo, from Vale do Javari reserve in northern Amazonas state, missionaries undermine the social cohesion of the community by favoring the leaders who support them.“The culture of our people is also weakened because certain practices are forbidden [by the missionaries], like traditional medicine,” Eliésio Marubo said. “The relationship with the territory also changes. Before, we used to move around a lot, but the missionaries want us to stay in one place only.”Vale do Javari is home to the largest number of isolated Indigenous people in the world: 10 out of the 28 confirmed groups of isolated people in Brazil. The reserve is also home to non-isolated Indigenous groups, like the Marubo.“It is a cultural destruction,” anthropologist Aparecida Vilaça said of the missions’ presence in Indigenous reserves. Vilaça witnessed the effects of missionary groups on an Indigenous community in Rondônia, also in the Amazon region. “They do a very deep process of humiliation of the traditional practices, by saying their dances and beliefs are things of the devil,” she said.According to Vilaça, these changes in the traditional way of life make the Indigenous people more vulnerable to several economic interests. “The missionaries lead to the settling of all the community in the same place, releasing land to farmers and loggers. We can’t forget that these lands are very coveted,” she said.Vilaça said the desire to convert Indigenous groups started with the colonization of Brazil, by the Catholic Church, and is now led by evangelical groups, some of which have deep pockets.Rejection of “consentement” thesisAs the lawyer for Univaja, the Union of Indigenous People of Vale do Javari, Eliésio Marubo went to court last year against Andrew Tonkin, a U.S. evangelical Baptist missionary who was planning to travel to the reserve amid the pandemic to contact isolated Indigenous groups.“Missionaries have been harassing us for 60 years,” he said. “They have helicopters, airplanes and they fly from here to the United States.”Besides granting Univaja’s request to ban Tonkin’s entry, a federal court also ordered the expulsion of missionaries still inside the territory. Despite the victory, the missionaries are still lurking, Eliésio Marubo said. “They remain on the borders of the reserve, trying to co-opt people,” he told Mongabay over the phone.In a setback for the Indigenous groups, Justice Barroso denied their request to remove the missionaries already inside the reserves. Besides creating a risk of contagion, Barroso said — since evicting them could “require third parties to enter such areas” — it was not clear that isolated groups had not consented to their presence.“How can you give consent for something that you have no idea what it is? To people who don’t even speak their language?” Vilaça said. She added that missionaries use several strategies to win over the isolated people. “They offer axes, knives, and other benefits to those who join them.”In their argument to the STF, the Indigenous groups noted that the way isolated communities express their will is different from the rest of society. “Our society gives prevalence to speech, to writing, and these people are talking to us in a different way. When they run away or attack an approaching person, it is a way of saying no,” Santana said.Barroso’s ruling is a precautionary measure, meaning the case will be subject to trial in the STF plenary. In a statement, the office of Brazil’s attorney general said it had been notified of the decision but will only manifest in the court. Funai didn’t reply to requests for comment.Related listening from Mongabay’s podcast: A discussion of the key role Indigenous peoples play in biodiversity conservation, listen here:FEEDBACK: Use this form to send a message to the author of this post.

World Indigenous Peoples Day: How net-zero climate goal alienates tribals,"Promotion of net-zero climate targets may alienate tribals from their land when science tells us that there is simply not enough landThe impacts of climate change have become tangible, and polluters across the world can no longer just pretend to care. So they have come up with yet another pledge (in a long list of unfulfilled pledges): The ‘net-zero’ goal, which has all the potential to worsen the ongoing climate injustices faced by the marginalised indigenous communities.Net-zero is about balancing total emitted greenhouse gases (GHG) with total GHG removals from the atmosphere (negative emissions) over a specified time. It makes sense as a scientific concept, but since carbon-capture technologies remain unproven, most of the ‘netting’ will rely on land-based removal and storage of carbon dioxide.A new report by Oxfam, a confederation of 20 charitable organisations focusing on the alleviation of global poverty, on net-zero has warned how these poorly defined climate targets can end up relying on vast swathes of land to capture carbon emissions, allowing the biggest emitters to continue business as usual and distracting us from demanding real action from them, which is to ask for significant and rapid cuts in their own emissions.The report also warned that this could lead to an explosion in demand for land which might end up increasing hunger and fuelling land inequality.The fears are not unfounded. In the past few months, we have seen countries and corporates falling over one another to announce their net-zero years. Everyone likes to postpone and outsource their dirty, difficult problems instead of taking responsibility and doing the hard work in the present.So, after the political and corporate grandstanding, the focus of climate conservation has now shifted to carbon removals from emission reduction. Questionable interventions like biofuels, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, geo-engineering, monoculture plantations, carbon offsets and other techno-fixes have got a new lease of life since net-zero’s inception.Since this get-out-of-jail-free card provides an easy way out, it is not surprising that the private sector is excited about this repackaged version of carbon development mechanisms, which failed miserably in making any meaningful reduction in emissions. Instead, it succeeded in giving emitters the license to keep polluting.The renewed attempt at greenwashing does not augur well for biodiversity, wildlife and indigenous communities around the world, especially in the global south, where land will be the prime target for such developments.Of the whole gamut of greenwashing gimmicks, carbon offsets via plantations pose an imminent threat to indigenous and common lands, not because tree planting is bad, but because top-down imposition of plantation is generally done with scant regard for ecology or local community consent.The tribal people and much of their lands in India have already been sacrificed at the altar of ‘development’ and carbon offsetting plantation is the latest ‘public-good’ coming for the remaining land. What’s happening with compensatory afforestation in India should be a good indication of the things to come with similar carbon plantations in future.A recent analysis by Land Conflict Watch (LCW), a non-profit that maps and analyses ongoing land conflicts in India, showed how such afforestation drives appropriate indigenous community lands and cause massive conflicts between the tribal community and the state.More than a hundred thousand hectares of such contested land is locked in compensatory plantations-related conflicts, affecting over 50,000 forest dwellers across six states that have claimed traditional rights over these lands. The irony here is unmistakable.First, the state cuts old-growth forests and evicts tribal people from their homeland. It then uses the compensation money from the resultant loss of trees to appropriate more tribal land in the name of planting saplings.The LCW report also highlighted that more than a million forest dwellers are affected by similar land conflicts related to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act [FRA], 2006, which was meant to undo historic injustice to India’s forest dwelling indigenous community and recognise their rights over traditional forestlands.Poorly planned and unsolicited monoculture plantations are not the newest state and corporate sponsored activity threatening indigenous and common lands. Even next generation green solutions, such as solar and wind power, are embroiled in massive land conflicts.For instance, the 15 megawatt solar power plant being established by a private company in Nagaon, Assam, illegally captured fertile indigenous land in collusion with the state government, according to a fact-finding study by the Delhi Solidarity Group, a platform that works to support and strengthen peoples' movements.In Kachchh, Gujarat, tribal herdsmen and farmers have been fighting to protect their forests and common grazing lands from the construction of windmills that has flattened hills and destroyed hundreds of trees. There are plenty of such cases of green projects driven land conflicts across the length and breadth of the country.With India targeting 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, these conflicts are set to rise, threatening tribal displacement and land dispossession.On the other hand, the passing of the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Amendment Bill, 2021 will now make it easier to acquire land for coal mining. This is in addition to the Centre’s earlier decision to open commercial coal mining for private sector.For a country that wants to champion the cause of renewable energy, opening new coal mines will not contribute to the need for clean energy transition. Tribal lands would be at greater risk soon, which would pose a real threat to dispossession of forests and common land.And if there wasn’t enough pressure on indigenous land from carbon emitting activities like mining and deforestation, the powers that be have conveniently put the onus of carbon removal on land-based mitigation measures.Promotion of net-zero climate targets re-opens the very real possibility of more tribal land alienation even when science tells us that there is simply not enough land and no amount of tree planting can ‘net’ the amount of ever-increasing GHG emissions that we keep dumping into the atmosphere endlessly.The general attitude towards our indigenous community has always been to treat them as second-class citizens. Their lives and lands are the cost we are ready to pay to keep our ‘economic growth’ story intact.The maxim ‘justice delayed is justice denied’ cannot ring truer for one of the most discriminated communities of India, who should now also prepare to bear the brunt of climate solutions that will demand vast tracts of their private and common land.While it would be worthwhile to reiterate and deliberate in the hundreds of webinars lined up to celebrate World Indigenous Day on August 9, the rest of the population surely needs more awareness and education about the state of the adivasis — the ‘original inhabitants’ of the world.Views expressed are the authors’ own and don’t necessarily reflect those of Down To Earth"
